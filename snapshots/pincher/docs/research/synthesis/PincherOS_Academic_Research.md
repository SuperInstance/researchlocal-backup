## 1. JEPA — Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture

### Key Papers & Authors

| Paper | Authors | Date | Contribution |
|-------|---------|------|-------------|
| **V-JEPA 2: Self-Supervised Video Models Enable Understanding, Prediction, and Planning** | Meta FAIR (Assran et al.) | Jun 2025 | arXiv:2506.09985 — First world model trained on video achieving SOTA visual understanding + zero-shot robot planning. 8B parameter model trained on 1M+ hours of video. Action-conditioned variant (V-JEPA 2-AC) post-trained on 62 hours of robot videos for zero-shot Franka control. |
| **Value-Guided Action Planning with JEPA World Models** | Destrade, Bounou, Le Lidec, Ponce, **LeCun** | Jan 2026 | arXiv:2601.00844 — Directly addresses how to USE JEPA for planning. Shapes representation space so negative goal-conditioned distance serves as value function. This is the "predict-then-veto" mechanism PincherOS needs. |
| **What Drives Success in Physical Planning with Joint-Embedding Predictive World Models** | Sobal et al. | Dec 2025 | arXiv:2512.24497 — Systematic analysis of what makes JEPA world models succeed/fail at planning. Identifies key architectural choices. |
| **EB-JEPA: A Lightweight Library for Energy-Based JEPA** | Meta FAIR | Feb 2026 | arXiv:2602.03604 — Open-source PyTorch library for JEPA research. Modular, composable, designed for community experimentation. |
| **I-JEPA** | Assran et al. (Meta FAIR) | 2023, updated 2024 | First image-based JEPA. Non-generative, predicts in latent space. Code: `github.com/facebookresearch/ijepa` |
| **V-JEPA** | Bardes et al. (Meta FAIR) | 2024 | Video extension. Code: `github.com/facebookresearch/jepa` |
| **A Path Towards Autonomous Machine Intelligence v0.9.2** | **Yann LeCun** | 2024 (OpenReview) | The foundational position paper defining H-JEPA (Hierarchical JEPA), objective-driven AI, the full architecture with configurator, cost module, actor, world model, and critic. |

### Maturity Assessment
- **I-JEPA/V-JEPA**: Production-quality research code (Meta FAIR). V-JEPA 2 demonstrates real robot planning.
- **H-JEPA**: Still theoretical — no public implementation of the full hierarchical system LeCun envisions.
- **Value-guided planning with JEPA**: Early research (Jan 2026), proof-of-concept only.
- **EB-JEPA library**: Just released (Feb 2026), experimental but well-structured.

### Open Problems/Gaps
1. **No complete H-JEPA implementation** — the full hierarchical world model with multi-level abstraction remains theoretical.
2. **Action-conditioning is nascent** — V-JEPA 2-AC uses only 62 hours of robot data; scaling action-conditioned prediction is an open challenge.
3. **Planning in abstract spaces is unsolved** — value-guided planning works in simple environments but hasn't been demonstrated at the complexity of general agent actions.
4. **Integration with language** — JEPA operates on perceptual embeddings; bridging to symbolic/linguistic action spaces is an open research problem.

### Implementations/Repos to Leverage
- `github.com/facebookresearch/jepa` — V-JEPA official codebase (PyTorch)
- `github.com/facebookresearch/eb_jepa` — EB-JEPA library (modular, extensible)
- `github.com/facebookresearch/ijepa` — I-JEPA official codebase

### Feasibility for PincherOS
**Medium-High.** JEPA is the most mature component conceptually, but adapting it from video/perceptual prediction to *agent action outcome prediction* requires significant research. The value-guided planning paper (2601.00844) provides the closest blueprint: use JEPA to predict outcomes in latent space, compute a "cost" function, and veto actions where predicted cost exceeds a threshold. Start with EB-JEPA as the base library and add action-conditioning.

**Recommended approach:** Don't try to build H-JEPA from scratch. Use V-JEPA 2-AC's action-conditioned variant as a reference, and train a lightweight JEPA on *command execution trajectories* (not video) to predict outcomes of shell commands before execution.

## 2. Vector Database as OS State (LanceDB)

### Key Papers & Projects

| Resource | Origin | Date | Relevance |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|
| **LanceDB OSS** | LanceDB Inc. | 2024–2026 | `github.com/lancedb/lancedb` — Developer-friendly embedded vector database. Rust core, Python/JS/TS bindings. Zero-config, runs in-process (no server). Lance columnar format. |
| **LanceDB Cloud** | LanceDB Inc. | 2025 | Serverless vector lakehouse with S3 backing. |
| **SQL Server 2025 Vector** | Microsoft | 2025 | Native vector support in SQL Server, indicating mainstream adoption. |
| **"Best Vector Databases in 2026"** | Firecrawl | May 2026 | LanceDB positioned as best for "edge deployments, local-first apps." |
| **HypeReca: Distributed In-Memory Embedding Cache** | USENIX ATC 2025 | 2025 | Production-grade distributed embedding serving for DLRMs. |

### Maturity Assessment
- **LanceDB**: Production-ready. Used in production by multiple companies. Rust core → embeddable in any system. Supports both local (embedded) and cloud modes.
- **Vector-DB-as-state pattern**: Emerging. No one has publicly built an OS where the vector DB IS the application, but the pattern of using vector stores for agent memory is widespread (LangChain, LlamaIndex).

### Open Problems/Gaps
1. **Transactional semantics** — Vector DBs lack ACID guarantees. If the vector DB IS the OS, you need crash recovery and transactional consistency.
2. **Schema evolution** — Agent state evolves; vector DBs are schema-flexible but this makes migration harder.
3. **Query composition** — Complex multi-hop queries over vector state are still limited.
4. **Deterministic retrieval** — Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) is non-deterministic; an OS needs deterministic behavior.

### Implementations/Repos
- `github.com/lancedb/lancedb` — Core LanceDB (Rust + Python)
- LanceDB supports full-text search + vector search + filtering in a single query
- Native Lance format avoids the "three copies" problem (raw data + metadata + embeddings)

### Feasibility for PincherOS
**High.** LanceDB is arguably the best-fit vector DB for PincherOS because:
- **Embedded mode**: No server process, runs in-process with the agent — perfect for the "hermit crab" model
- **Rust core**: Can be compiled into the shell binary
- **Edge-friendly**: Specifically designed for local-first/edge deployments
- **Lance format**: Single table for raw data + embeddings + features, avoiding state fragmentation
- **Zero-config**: No admin overhead for migration

**Key challenge:** Building a transaction/log layer on top of LanceDB so that OS state changes are atomic and recoverable. Consider a write-ahead log (WAL) layer.

## 3. Penrose Tensors — Non-Periodic Memory Geometry

### Key Papers & Discoveries

| Paper | Authors | Date | Contribution |
|-------|---------|------|-------------|
| **The Penrose Tiling is a Quantum Error-Correcting Code** | Boyle & Farkas | Nov 2023 (updated Jan 2024) | arXiv:2311.13040 — **Landmark proof** that Penrose tilings are mathematically equivalent to a quantum error-correcting code. Any local errors/erasures in any finite region can be corrected. This provides the theoretical basis for Penrose-based memory structures. |
| **Penrose Tiled Low-Rank Compression and Section-Wise Q&A Fine-Tuning** | Unknown | Mar 2025 | arXiv:2503.22074 — **Directly relevant**: Proposes Penrose Tiled Low-Rank Decomposition — a novel non-periodic partitioning of large weight matrices into rank blocks, inspired by quasicrystalline structures. Combines structured model compression with fine-tuning. |
| **Never-Repeating Tiles Can Safeguard Quantum Information** | Quanta Magazine (coverage) | Feb 2024 | Popular explanation of Boyle-Farkas result. |
| **Tensor Networks and Efficient Descriptions of Classical Data** | Phys. Rev. A 111, 032409 | 2025 | Investigates tensor-network ML methods for large datasets. |
| **Efficient Compression of LLMs Based on Tensor Networks** | OpenReview | 2025 | Token embedding compression using tensor networks for edge deployment. |

### Maturity Assessment
- **Penrose as QEC code**: Theoretical proof (2024), no practical classical implementation yet.
- **Penrose Tiled Low-Rank Decomposition**: Early research (Mar 2025), applies to weight matrix compression.
- **Tensor network memory structures**: Active research area but no production implementations for classical computing memory.

### Open Problems/Gaps
1. **Classical adaptation** — The Penrose QEC result is quantum. Adapting it to classical error correction for vector storage is unexplored.
2. **No "Penrose Tensor" implementation** — The idea of weaving trajectories into aperiodic tensor networks is novel and has no prior art. You'd be creating this.
3. **Scaling** — Tensor network methods scale well for certain topologies (MPS, PEPS) but Penrose (5-fold symmetric) tensor networks are unexplored.
4. **Information density vs. retrieval** — Aperiodic tilings have rich structure but accessing arbitrary patterns efficiently is an open question.

### Implementations/Repos
- No existing implementation of "Penrose tensors" for memory.
- `arXiv:2503.22074` provides the closest reference implementation for Penrose-tiling-based low-rank decomposition.
- Multiverse Computing's quantum-inspired tensor networks: commercial, but not open-source.

### Feasibility for PincherOS
**Low-Medium (theoretical risk is high, but upside is enormous).** This is the most novel and risky component. The mathematical foundation exists (Penrose tilings = error-correcting code), but:
- No one has built a classical memory system using Penrose tensor geometry
- The concept of "infinite concept scaling without linear memory scaling" via aperiodic structures is theoretically plausible but unproven
- The closest practical work is the Penrose low-rank decomposition paper (2503.22074), which proves the tiling concept works for matrix compression

**Recommended approach:** Build a proof-of-concept using Penrose-tiled low-rank decomposition (per arXiv:2503.22074) as the memory layout for a subset of LanceDB tables. Start with the compression benefit (which is proven) and explore the error-correction and scaling properties experimentally. Don't make this a critical-path dependency — have a fallback to standard vector storage.

## 4. Capability-Based Security + Landlock

### Key Papers & Projects

| Resource | Origin | Date | Contribution |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|
| **Sandlock: Confining AI Agent Code with Unprivileged Linux Primitives** | arXiv:2605.26298 | May 2026 | **Directly relevant**: Rust process sandbox for AI agents using Landlock for filesystem/TCP/IPC scoping, combined with seccomp for syscall filtering, and user namespaces for privilege reduction. |
| **Landlock LSM** | Linux Kernel (Mickaël Salaün) | Linux 5.13+ (2021), actively updated 2024–2026 | Kernel-level unprivileged sandboxing. Stackable LSM. Latest: network scope (TCP port) restrictions added in kernel 6.7+. Configuration format in development. |
| **Tenuo: Capability Authorization for AI Agents** | tenuo-ai | 2025–2026 | `github.com/tenuo-ai/tenuo` — **Critical find**: Cryptographic capability token infrastructure for AI agents. Pure Rust core with Python bindings. 27μs token verification. Task-scoped tokens with TTL, argument constraints, and consumable budgets. Maps directly to the `fs:read:/path, net:https:domain.com` capability model. |
| **Landrun** | Community | 2025 | CLI tool for sandboxing any Linux process using Landlock without root. |
| **Rust Landlock crate** | landlock.io | Active | `crates.io/crates/landlock` — Official Rust bindings for Landlock syscalls. |
| **ai-sandbox crate** | crates.io | 2025 | `crates.io/crates/ai-sandbox` — Cross-platform AI tool sandbox security in Rust. |

### Maturity Assessment
- **Landlock LSM**: Production in Linux kernel since 5.13. Actively maintained. Network scoping added recently. **Production-ready.**
- **Tenuo**: Early but functional. Cryptographic capability tokens designed specifically for AI agents. **Prototype → Production.**
- **Sandlock**: Research paper (May 2026) with working Rust implementation. **Prototype.**
- **Capability-based security in OS**: Well-established theory (Capability-based OS research from 1970s–80s, Capsicum in FreeBSD, seL4). Modern revival with JWT-like tokens.

### Open Problems/Gaps
1. **GPU/accelerator sandboxing** — Landlock restricts filesystem and network but doesn't scope GPU access. For PincherOS shells with GPUs, this is a gap.
2. **Capability composition** — How to compose capabilities (e.g., `fs:read:/data` AND `net:https:api.example.com`) into a single token with combined constraints.
3. **Cross-platform** — Landlock is Linux-only. macOS has Seatbelt; Windows has its own sandboxing. No unified capability framework.
4. **Revocation** — JWT-like tokens are hard to revoke once issued. Need a revocation/CRL mechanism.

### Implementations/Repos
- `github.com/tenuo-ai/tenuo` — **Primary recommendation**: Capability tokens for AI agents
- `github.com/landlock-lsm/rust-landlock` — Rust Landlock bindings
- `crates.io/crates/ai-sandbox` — Cross-platform AI sandbox
- Sandlock paper (arXiv:2605.26298) provides reference architecture

### Feasibility for PincherOS
**Very High.** This is the most practical and immediately implementable component. The pieces exist today:
1. **Tenuo** provides the JWT-like capability token system with cryptographic verification
2. **Landlock** provides kernel-level enforcement on Linux
3. **Sandlock** provides the reference architecture for combining both

**Recommended approach:** Use Tenuo for capability token issuance and verification. Map each PincherOS command to a capability token (e.g., `fs:read:/path`, `net:https:domain.com`). Before executing any command, verify the token. Enforce with Landlock at the process level. The Sandlock paper provides the exact Rust implementation pattern. Add GPU capability scoping as a custom extension.

## 5. A2UI (Agent-to-UI Protocol)

### Key Papers & Projects

| Resource | Origin | Date | Contribution |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|
| **A2UI Specification** | Google | 2025–2026 | `github.com/google/a2ui` — Open-source protocol for agent-driven interfaces. Defines a format for representing updatable agent-generated UIs. Initial renderers for web, mobile, and terminal. |
| **"Introducing A2UI" blog** | Google Developers Blog | 2025 | Official announcement. A2UI addresses "interoperable, cross-platform, generative or template-based UI responses from agents." |
| **A2UI.org** | Google | 2025–2026 | Official site. "A protocol for agent-driven interfaces. A2UI enables AI agents to generate rich, interactive user interfaces that render natively across web, mobile, and terminal." |
| **A2UI + ADK integration** | Google | Mar 2026 | Guide for using A2UI with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK). |
| **CopilotKit A2UI+AG-UI** | CopilotKit | 2025–2026 | Integration guide for building full-stack A2UI agents using A2A protocol. |

### Maturity Assessment
- **A2UI specification**: v0.x — active development by Google. Not yet a standard but has official Google backing.
- **Renderers**: Initial web, mobile, and terminal renderers exist.
- **Integration**: Works with Google ADK and Gemini Enterprise. CopilotKit building on top of it.

### Open Problems/Gaps
1. **Specification stability** — A2UI is still evolving; breaking changes possible.
2. **Custom component model** — A2UI defines a set of allowed components; extending for PincherOS-specific UIs may require custom renderers.
3. **Offline/edge rendering** — A2UI assumes agent can generate UI specs; on edge devices, the rendering pipeline needs to be lightweight.
4. **Bidirectional UI** — A2UI is primarily agent→UI; handling UI→agent events (user input) is less mature.

### Implementations/Repos
- `github.com/google/a2ui` — Official spec + renderers
- `a2ui.org` — Documentation

### Feasibility for PincherOS
**High.** A2UI is almost purpose-built for PincherOS's needs. The agent generates a UI spec (structured data), which renders natively on whatever shell it's running on. This is exactly the "A2UI" component described in the PincherOS concept.

**Recommended approach:** Use A2UI as the UI protocol layer. When the rigging (agent) migrates to a new shell, it generates A2UI specs that the shell renders using the appropriate renderer (web on desktop, terminal on headless, mobile on phone). Build a custom A2UI renderer for the PincherOS shell that maps to the available display capabilities of the current hardware.

## 6. Pythagorean Snapping — Boot/Migration Algorithm

### Key Papers & Projects

| Resource | Origin | Date | Contribution |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|
| **Adaptive AI Agent Placement and Migration in Edge Intelligence Systems** | arXiv:2508.03345 | Aug 2025 | **First systematic framework** for LLM-based AI agent placement and migration in dynamic edge environments. Models resource constraints and latency/reliability trade-offs. Proposes adaptive framework for placement and migration decisions. |
| **NVIDIA Jetson Nano Super** | NVIDIA | 2025 | Eight-node Jetson Nano cluster serving multiple LLMs (Gemma 2 2B, Llama 3.2 3B). Demonstrates edge LLM deployment. |
| **NVIDIA GTC 2025: Resilient Edge-Cloud Hybrid AI Infrastructure** | NVIDIA | 2025 | Orchestrating multi-modal workloads across edge-cloud continuum. |
| **Red Hat hardened image-based OS for AI agents** | Red Hat | 2025 | Immutable OS images (bootc) for AI agents. Controlled execution paths, observability. |

### Maturity Assessment
- **Agent migration frameworks**: Early research (2025). No production systems yet.
- **Edge AI deployment**: Production (NVIDIA Jetson ecosystem, Qualcomm AI Hub).
- **Hardware-adaptive model serving**: Production (vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, ONNX Runtime).

### Open Problems/Gaps
1. **State serialization for migration** — How to serialize an agent's complete state (including vector DB, JEPA world model, capability tokens) for migration between shells.
2. **Shell capability negotiation** — How the rigging discovers what the shell offers (GPU, memory, display, sensors) and adapts.
3. **Migration latency** — How long migration takes and whether the agent can remain operational during migration.
4. **Heterogeneous shells** — Different GPU architectures (Jetson vs. RTX), different OS kernels, different sensor suites.

### Implementations/Repos
- arXiv:2508.03345 provides the theoretical framework
- NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM for hardware-adaptive inference
- ONNX Runtime for cross-platform model execution
- Red Hat bootc for immutable OS images

### Feasibility for PincherOS
**Medium.** "Pythagorean Snapping" is a novel algorithm that doesn't exist yet. However, the constituent pieces are available:
1. **Shell discovery**: Use a hardware capability descriptor (JSON/CDDL) that the shell provides at boot
2. **Fit calculation**: Combine the arXiv:2508.03345 placement framework with a multi-dimensional distance metric between rigging requirements and shell capabilities
3. **Resource optimization**: Use TensorRT-LLM/ONNX for model adaptation

**Recommended approach:** Define a "Shell Manifest" (JSON schema describing hardware capabilities: GPU VRAM, CPU cores, RAM, display resolution, sensors, network). Define a "Rigging Manifest" (what the agent needs: minimum model size, memory, UI capabilities). The "Pythagorean Snap" algorithm computes a fit score (weighted Euclidean distance in capability space) and determines: (a) can the rigging run on this shell? (b) what model size/configuration to use? (c) what capabilities to enable/disable?

## 7. Asymptotic Zero-Cost Model Usage (LLM as Compiler)

### Key Papers & Projects

| Resource | Origin | Date | Contribution |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|
| **Prompt Cache: Modular Attention Reuse for Low-Latency Inference** | Gim et al. | MLSys 2024 | arXiv:2311.04934 — Reuses attention states across prompts. Up to 60% latency reduction for repeated prompt prefixes. |
| **Evaluation of Prompt Caching for Long-Horizon Agentic Tasks** | arXiv:2601.06007 | Jan 2026 | Prompt caching reduces API costs by 41–80% and improves TTFT by 13–31% across providers. |
| **Speculative Cascades** | Google Research | 2025 | Hybrid approach combining speculative decoding with model cascading for faster, cheaper inference. |
| **TensorRT-LLM Speculative Decoding** | NVIDIA | 2024–2025 | Up to 3.6x throughput improvement via speculative decoding. |
| **Compiler vs Interpreter — Why LangGraph Is Becoming Your Hot Path Cost Center** | Jarek Wasowski | 2025 | **Key concept**: "Agentic workflow distillation compiles a multi-step agent process into smaller model weights." The LLM-as-compiler pattern: use the LLM once to compile a workflow, then execute the compiled version without the LLM. |
| **The Cost of Dynamic Reasoning: Demystifying AI Agents and Test-Time Compute** | arXiv:2506.04301 | Jun 2025 | Analyzes the true cost of agentic reasoning at inference time. |
| **Model Distillation for LLMs** | Redis blog | 2026 | Practical guide to distillation for cost reduction. |

### Maturity Assessment
- **Prompt caching**: Production (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google all support it). Immediate cost savings.
- **Speculative decoding**: Production (TensorRT-LLM, vLLM).
- **Workflow distillation**: Early concept (blog post, not peer-reviewed paper). The "compiler vs interpreter" metaphor is powerful but no formal framework exists.
- **Model distillation**: Production (many tools, well-understood).

### Open Problems/Gaps
1. **Automatic distillation of agent trajectories** — How to take a recorded sequence of LLM calls + tool uses and compile it into a smaller model that produces the same outputs.
2. **Reflex formation** — When does a repeated pattern become a "reflex" that bypasses the LLM entirely?
3. **Graceful degradation** — When the compiled reflex fails, how to fall back to full LLM reasoning.
4. **Compilation vs. interpretation boundary** — How to decide what to compile and what to interpret in real-time.

### Implementations/Repos
- `github.com/MachineLearningSystem/24MLSYS-prompt-cache` — Prompt Cache reference implementation
- OpenAI/Anthropic/Google built-in prompt caching (API-level)
- vLLM / TensorRT-LLM for speculative decoding
- Knowledge distillation tools: DistilKit, TextBrewer

### Feasibility for PincherOS
**Medium-High.** The concept of "LLM as compiler" can be implemented in phases:

**Phase 1 (Immediate):** Use prompt caching aggressively. PincherOS already has a vector DB of all state — use LanceDB as a semantic cache so repeated queries hit the cache, not the LLM. Expected: 40–80% cost reduction per arXiv:2601.06007.

**Phase 2 (Short-term):** Implement trajectory recording. Every LLM invocation + tool call + result is stored in LanceDB. When a new query matches a stored trajectory (cosine similarity in embedding space), replay the trajectory instead of invoking the LLM.

**Phase 3 (Medium-term):** Implement "reflex compilation." When a trajectory pattern is matched N times (configurable threshold), compile it into a deterministic function that bypasses the LLM entirely. The LLM "compiled" this function; now it runs without the LLM.

**Phase 4 (Long-term):** Use model distillation to create a smaller, specialized model for the most common PincherOS operations, running locally on the shell.

## 8. Edge AI / Shell Portability

### Key Papers & Projects

| Resource | Origin | Date | Contribution |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|
| **Adaptive AI Agent Placement and Migration in Edge Intelligence** | arXiv:2508.03345 | Aug 2025 | Framework for deploying and migrating LLM-based agents across edge devices. |
| **Jetson Nano Super** | NVIDIA | 2025 | $249, 128 CUDA cores, 8GB RAM. Can run Gemma 2 2B, Llama 3.2 3B. Eight-node cluster demonstrated. |
| **NVIDIA Jetson Thor** | NVIDIA/Advantech | 2025 | Next-gen edge AI SoC for robotics and medical AI. |

| **Federated Edge AI frameworks** | Various | 2025 | Cross-industry model adaptability and collaboration. |
| **LLM on Edge survey** | MDPI Mathematics | 2025 | Systematic review of model sparsity, quantization, and deployment techniques for edge. |

### Maturity Assessment
- **Edge LLM inference**: Production (llama.cpp, MLX, TensorRT-LLM, ONNX Runtime)
- **Model quantization for edge**: Production (GGUF, AWQ, GPTQ, bitsandbytes)
- **Adaptive agent deployment**: Research (arXiv:2508.03345)
- **Cross-device migration**: No production solution exists

### Open Problems/Gaps
1. **Dynamic model selection** — Automatically choosing the right model size for the current shell's resources.
2. **Partial model offloading** — Running some layers on-device, some in the cloud.
3. **State portability across architectures** — Migrating agent state between ARM (Jetson) and x86 (workstation).
4. **Graceful degradation** — What the agent does when it lands on a shell with insufficient resources.

### Implementations/Repos
- `github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp` — Runs LLMs on everything from phones to workstations
- NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM — Optimized inference on NVIDIA hardware
- Apple MLX — Optimized for Apple Silicon
- ONNX Runtime — Cross-platform inference

### Feasibility for PincherOS
**High.** The infrastructure for running LLMs on diverse hardware is mature. The key addition PincherOS needs:

1. **Tiered model strategy**: Keep 3 versions of the agent model (large for RTX workstations, medium for laptops, small for Jetson). Use GGUF quantization at different levels.
2. **Shell detection at boot**: On migration, detect hardware capabilities and select the appropriate model tier.
3. **llama.cpp as the inference backbone**: It runs everywhere, supports GGUF, and handles CPU/GPU offloading automatically.
4. **Cloud fallback**: If the shell can't run any model, fall back to API-based inference (OpenAI/Anthropic) with aggressive caching.

| **Zero-Cost LLM** | Medium-High | Production (caching) → Conceptual (distillation) | Reflex compilation is unproven at scale | Phase approach: caching → trajectory replay → reflex compilation |
| **Edge Portability** | High | Production | State portability across architectures | llama.cpp + tiered GGUF models + cloud fallback |
