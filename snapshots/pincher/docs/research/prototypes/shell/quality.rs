//! ShellQuality — First-class shell health metric WITH thermodynamics.

//! The biologist showed that shell quality determines vacancy chain

//! A healthy shell attracts upgrade cascades.
//!
//! R3: The thermodynamicist adds energy state as a FIRST-CLASS quality
//! dimension. Shell quality is now a function of BOTH hardware health
//! AND energy availability. A battery-powered shell with 5% charge is
//! a DIFFERENT shell than the same hardware on AC, regardless of health.
