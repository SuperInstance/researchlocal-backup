//! PincherOS Shell Module — Unified GPU/Rust Architecture
//!
//! R2 Integration: Resolves the GPU/CPU tension.
//! CRDT merge is ALWAYS on CPU. GPU is for inference only.
//!
//! R3 Integration: Thermodynamics module closes the Energy Gap (SG-4).
//! Every operation now has a joules dimension.
//! Landauer's principle applied: kT·ln(2) per bit erased.
//! CRDT merge is logically reversible → zero Landauer cost (in principle).
//! Consent is an entropy-reduction mechanism.
