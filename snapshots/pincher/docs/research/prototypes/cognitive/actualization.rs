//! Power-law actualization model for reflex trust.
//!
//! Based on:
//! - Newell & Rosenbloom (1981): Power law of practice
//! - Wixted (2004): Power law of forgetting
//! - McClelland, McNaughton & O'Reilly (1995): Complementary learning systems
//! - Bahrick et al. (1993): Spacing effect
//!
//! Key insight: reflex confidence follows a power-law actualization curve
//! (fast early learning, slow approach to asymptote) combined with a
//! power-law forgetting curve (old memories decay more slowly).
//! This is fundamentally different from the exponential decay currently
//! used in the CRDT access rate tracker.
