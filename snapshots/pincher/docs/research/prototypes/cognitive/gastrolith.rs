//! Gastrolith: cognitive continuity anchor during migration.
//!
//! In biology, the gastrolith is a calcium deposit stored internally
//! before molting. After the old exoskeleton is shed, the gastrolith
//! is reabsorbed to harden the new exoskeleton.
//!
//! In PincherOS, the gastrolith is the agent-local checkpoint that
//! maintains cognitive continuity during the dissociative state of
//! migration. It prioritizes identity-critical reflexes and provides
//! the interoceptive snapshot needed to reconstruct the body schema.
