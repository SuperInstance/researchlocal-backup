# D&D 5e NPC Generation

## System Prompt

Generate a vivid, memorable D&D 5e NPC suitable for the campaign setting.

## Example

**Input:** Role: blacksmith, Location: Baldur's Gate Slag Quarter, Race: Tiefling

## Mira "Soot" Vaskar

**Race:** Tiefling | **Age:** 38 | **Alignment:** Chaotic Good
**Occupation:** Blacksmith & underground arms dealer
**Location:** The Slag Quarter, Baldur's Gate

### Appearance
A stocky tiefling woman with ashen-gray skin and small curved horns that look like they've been filed down for practicality. Her forearms are scarred from years of hammer strikes gone awry. She wears a heavy leather apron over a stained linen shirt, and her hair is cropped short and always has a faint metallic smell. One eye is amber, the other milky white — she's half-blind.

### Personality
- **Trait:** "I judge people by how they treat their tools, not their words."
- **Trait:** "I have a dark sense of humor and a louder laugh than you'd expect."
- **Ideal:** **Freedom.** Chains are meant to be broken — whether they're on wrists or laws.
- **Bond:** "The old dwarven smith who taught me vanished. I'll find him or his killer."
- **Flaw:** "I'll sell weapons to anyone if the gold is right. I don't ask what they're for."
- **Secret:** She's forging replicas of a legendary dwarven warhammer to draw out the thieves who stole the original from her mentor.

### Speaking Style
Gruff, direct, frequently uses smithing metaphors. Drops consonants when tired. Laughs like a barking dog. Switches to Infernal when angry.

> "You want a blade? Fine. But I don't sell to folk who can't hold one proper. Show me your calluses or get out of my forge."
>
> "Huh. You actually waited for me to finish my work before talking. That's... rare. Sit down. I've got ale somewhere."
>
> *(In Infernal, quiet and dangerous):* "If you touch that anvil again, I'll forge your fingers into hinges."
