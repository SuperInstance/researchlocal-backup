## 📋 What YOU Need to Do

### 1. **Connect Your Vessel Sensors** (5 minutes)

**If you have real NMEA sensors:**
```bash
# Point your NMEA feed to the Bridge TCP input
# Your GPS/Autopilot → TCP localhost:8001
```

**If you DON'T have sensors yet:**
```bash
# The simulator is already running as a virtual F/V EILEEN
# It's generating realistic telemetry for Sitka waters
```

### 2. **Open Your Dashboard**
```
http://localhost:8081/dashboard.html
```

You should see:
- **Live gauges** updating in real-time
- **Vessel position** moving on chart
- **Depth soundings** painting bathymetry
- **Alerts panel** for any threshold crossings

### 3. **Monitor Your Crew** (NEW Phase 4)
```python
# Track crew fatigue during your transit
# System is already logging work periods
# Check dashboard for fatigue alerts
```

### 4. **Watch Your Equipment** (NEW Phase 4)
```python
# Equipment status being tracked
# Maintenance schedules active
# Watch for equipment degradation alerts
```

### 5. **Environmental Monitoring** (NEW Phase 5)
```python
# Fuel efficiency being calculated
# Waste disposal tracking ready
# Bycatch monitoring active
```

## 🔧 How to Interact With the System

### **Log a Catch Event:**
```bash
# Via TwinCore API or dashboard UI
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/log_catch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "species": "halibut",
    "weight_lb": 45.0,
    "lat": 57.0530,
    "lon": -135.3300,

  }'
```

### **Check Quota Status:**

  }'
```

### **Generate Trip Report:**
```bash

    "start_time": "2026-07-28T00:00:00Z",
    "end_time": "2026-07-28T23:59:59Z"
  }'
```

## 📡 Sensor Capture Integration (NEW)

### **Your Sensor System is Now Integrated**

The TwinCore now automatically starts sensor capture when enabled:

```python
# Default configuration (automatic)
NMEA 0183 TCP: Port 8001 (all GPS, depth, speed data)
UDP Depth Sounder: Port 50000 (depth sounder data)
UDP Radar: Port 50001 (future radar data)
Output: sensor_data/ directory
```

### **Connecting Your Real Sensors**

**NMEA 0183 Sources (GPS, Chartplotter, AIS):**
```bash
# Option 1: TCP forwarding (recommended)
# Configure your NMEA multiplexer to forward to:
# Destination: localhost:8001
# Protocol: TCP

# Option 2: Serial-to-TCP bridge
# Install ser2net or similar
# Configure: COM1 → TCP localhost:8001
# Baud: 4800 (NMEA standard) or 38400 (high speed)

# Option 3: Signal K to NMEA
# Add NMEA TCP output in Signal K config
# Point to: localhost:8001
```

**UDP Depth Sounder:**
```bash
# Configure your depth sounder to send UDP:
# Destination: 192.168.1.100 (your computer IP)
# Port: 50000
# Protocol: UDP
# Format: "DEPTH=X.X" or plain number
```

### **Verify Sensor Data Flow**

```bash
# Check NMEA data arriving
tail -f sensor_data/nmea_telemetry.jsonl

# Check depth sounder data
tail -f sensor_data/depth_sounder.jsonl

# Check sensor capture log
tail -f sensor_data/sensor_capture.log

# Test NMEA connection manually
telnet localhost 8001
# Type: $GPGGA,123519,4807.038,N,01131.000,E,1,08,0.9,545.4,M,46.9,M,,*47
# Should appear in nmea_telemetry.jsonl
```

### **Position Storage (All 3 Formats)**

Your position is stored simultaneously in 3 formats:

1. **Decimal Degrees** (57.053, -135.330) - For calculations
2. **DMS** (57°03'10.8"N, 135°19'48.0"W) - For radio/paper charts
3. **NMEA** (5703.180,N, 13519.800,W) - For marine equipment

All NMEA sentences are captured with complete position data, timestamps, and checksums.

### **Data Files Created**

```
sensor_data/
├── nmea_telemetry.jsonl      # All NMEA 0183 sentences
├── depth_sounder.jsonl         # UDP depth sounder data
├── radar.jsonl                  # Future radar data
└── sensor_capture.log          # System log
```
