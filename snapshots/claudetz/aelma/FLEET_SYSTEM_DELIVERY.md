# Fleet Management System - Delivery Summary

## Overview

A complete multi-vessel fleet management system has been implemented for AELMA, enabling centralized management of multiple fishing vessels from a single instance.

## Delivered Components

### 1. Core Fleet Management (`twin/fleet_manager.py`)

**FleetManager Class:**
- Multi-vessel registration and lifecycle management
- Fleet-level analytics and summaries
- Inter-vessel distance calculations
- Vessel lookup by location and purpose
- Fleet-wide and targeted operations
- WebSocket API for fleet viewers

**VesselInstance Class:**
- Container for each vessel's isolated twin core
- Independent VesselState, BathymetryGrid, and data storage
- Per-vessel metrics and connection tracking

**Key Methods:**
- `register_vessel(vessel_id, config)` - Add vessel to fleet
- `get_all_positions()` - Get all vessel positions
- `get_vessel_state(vessel_id)` - Get specific vessel state
- `get_fleet_snapshot()` - Comprehensive fleet snapshot with analytics
- `broadcast_to_all(action, payload)` - Send action to all vessels
- `find_nearest(lat, lon, purpose)` - Find closest vessel
- `find_vessels_in_radius(lat, lon, radius_m)` - Find vessels within radius
- `get_distance_matrix()` - Inter-vessel distance matrix

### 2. Fleet Server (`twin/fleet_server.py`)

**FleetServer Class:**
- Production-ready fleet management server
- Connects to multiple vessel bridges as WebSocket clients
- Ingests telemetry from all vessels
- Provides fleet-wide WebSocket viewer API
- Broadcasts fleet snapshots to dashboard viewers
- Graceful shutdown and signal handling

**Usage:**
```bash
python -m twin.fleet_server --config fleet_config.json
```

### 3. Fleet-Level Analytics

**Position Summary:**
- Fleet bounds (min/max lat/lon)
- Centroid calculation
- Active vessel count

**Clustering Detection:**
- Groups vessels within 1000m radius
- Identifies largest cluster
- Computes cluster centers

**Alert Aggregation:**
- Critical alerts (no position fix)
- Warning alerts (disconnected, stale data)
- Info alerts (future extensibility)

**Distance Matrix:**
- Inter-vessel distances in meters
- Handles missing positions gracefully
- Efficient computation

### 4. Per-Vessel Isolation

**Independent State:**
- Each vessel has its own VesselState instance
- Isolated telemetry channels
- Separate bathymetry grids
- Independent A2A and operations logs
- Per-vessel metrics

**Data Storage:**
```
fleet_data/
├── US-AK-FVEILEEN-51/
│   ├── bathymetry_pioneer.json
│   ├── a2a_pioneer.jsonl
│   └── oplog_pioneer.jsonl
