### Key Features

#### 1. Comprehensive Validation
- All dataclasses include `__post_init__` validation
- Type checking with helpful error messages
- Timestamp validation (must be >= 0)
- Numerical validation (durations, costs >= 0)

#### 2. JSONL Persistence
- Append-only persistence for reliability
- Four separate files:
  - `equipment.jsonl` - Equipment records
  - `maintenance.jsonl` - Maintenance logs
  - `failures.jsonl` - Failure events
  - `schedules.jsonl` - Maintenance schedules
- Automatic directory creation
- Graceful handling of I/O errors

#### 3. Predictive Maintenance
Multiple prediction strategies:
- **Scheduled maintenance**: Due date calculation
- **Failure history (MTBF)**: Pattern-based predictions
- **Current status**: DEGRADED/MAINTENANCE_REQUIRED detection
- **Priority ranking**: critical > high > medium > low

#### 4. Analytics

**MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)**
- Calculates average time between consecutive failures
- Requires 2+ resolved failures
- Sorted chronologically for accuracy

**MTTR (Mean Time To Repair)**
- Average repair duration
- Based on resolved failures

**Equipment Uptime**
- Uptime percentage calculation
- Accounts for both resolved and unresolved failures
- Includes failure count

**Maintenance Cost Summary**
- Total cost and hours
- Breakdown by maintenance type
- Per-equipment or fleet-wide

#### 5. Alert Generation

Alerts generated for:
- **FAILED equipment** (critical severity)
- **DEGRADED equipment** (warning severity)
- **MAINTENANCE_REQUIRED** (high severity)
- **Overdue maintenance** (warning severity)
- **Unresolved CRITICAL failures** (critical severity)

#### 6. WatcherRegistry Integration

The `get_watcher_frame()` method provides real-time data for watcher rule evaluation:
- Equipment count and status breakdown
- Overdue maintenance count
- Unresolved failure counts by severity
- Total maintenance logs and failures

# Add equipment
engine = monitor.add_equipment(
    "ENG-001",
    "Main Engine",
    EquipmentType.ENGINE,
    "Engine Room"
)

# Update status
monitor.update_equipment_status("ENG-001", EquipmentStatus.OPERATIONAL)
```

### Maintenance Logging

```python
from twin.equipment_monitor import MaintenanceType

# Log maintenance
log_entry = monitor.log_maintenance(
    "ENG-001",
    MaintenanceType.ROUTINE,
    "Oil change and filter replacement",
    "tech_john",
    4.5,  # hours
    350.00  # cost
)

# Get maintenance history
history = monitor.get_maintenance_history("ENG-001")

# Get cost summary
summary = monitor.get_maintenance_cost_summary("ENG-001")
```

### Failure Management

```python
from twin.equipment_monitor import FailureType, Severity

# Log failure
failure = monitor.log_failure(
    "PUMP-001",
    FailureType.MECHANICAL,
    Severity.HIGH,
    "Bearing failure detected"
)

# Resolve failure
resolved = monitor.resolve_failure(
    "PUMP-001",
    "Replaced bearings",
    timestamp_ns=time.time_ns()
)
```

### Maintenance Scheduling

```python
from twin.equipment_monitor import MaintenanceType

# Schedule maintenance
schedule = monitor.schedule_maintenance(
    "ENG-001",
    MaintenanceType.ROUTINE,
    interval_hours=500.0
)

# Get due maintenance (next 24 hours)
due = monitor.get_due_maintenance(lookahead_hours=24)

# Get overdue
overdue = monitor.get_overdue_maintenance()
```

### Predictive Analytics

```python
# Predict maintenance needs (7-day lookahead)
predictions = monitor.predict_maintenance_needs(
    "ENG-001",
    lookahead_hours=168
)

# Calculate reliability metrics
mtbf = monitor.calculate_mtbf("ENG-001")  # Mean Time Between Failures
mttr = monitor.calculate_mttr("ENG-001")  # Mean Time To Repair
uptime = monitor.calculate_equipment_uptime("ENG-001")
```

### Alert Generation

```python
# Get all alerts
alerts = monitor.get_alerts()

for alert in alerts:
    print(f"[{alert['severity']}] {alert['code']}: {alert['message']}")
```

### Integration with TwinCore

```python
# In TwinCore, add equipment monitoring
from twin.equipment_monitor import EquipmentMonitor

class TwinCore:
    def __init__(self, ...):
        # ... existing initialization ...
        self.equipment_monitor = EquipmentMonitor(
            data_dir="equipment_data",
            enable_persistence=True
        )

    def handle_packet(self, packet: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        # ... existing packet handling ...

        # Update equipment frame for watchers
        equipment_frame = self.equipment_monitor.get_watcher_frame()
        self.state.channels["equipment"] = equipment_frame

    def get_alerts(self) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
        """Combine all system alerts."""
        alerts = []
        # ... existing alerts ...
        alerts.extend(self.equipment_monitor.get_alerts())
        return alerts
