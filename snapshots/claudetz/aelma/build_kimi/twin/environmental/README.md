# Environmental Stewardship System

Comprehensive environmental monitoring system for the AELMA twin commercial fishing vessel.

## Overview

The Environmental Stewardship system tracks fuel efficiency, carbon footprint, waste management, bycatch mitigation, and sustainability metrics for commercial fishing operations. It provides real-time monitoring, alert generation, and compliance tracking to support sustainable fishing practices.

## Features

### 1. Fuel Consumption Tracking
- **Fuel Types Supported**: Diesel, B20 Biodiesel, B100 Biodiesel, LNG, Electric
- **Tracking**: Quantity, source (engine/generator), location, engine hours
- **Emissions Calculation**: CO2, SOx, NOx, Particulate Matter based on EPA/IMO factors
- **Baseline Monitoring**: Automatic baseline calculation for emission trends

### 2. Carbon Footprint
- **Total Emissions**: CO2, SOx, NOx, PM in pounds
- **Emission Factors**: Per-gallon factors for each fuel type
- **Efficiency Metric**: 0-100 score based on total CO2 output
- **Trend Analysis**: Comparison against baseline with alerting

### 3. Waste Management

- **Low Fuel Efficiency**: <15 nm/gal
- **High Bycatch Ratio**: >5% of total catch
- **Waste Noncompliance**: >10% improper disposal

## Installation

The system is part of the AELMA twin and requires no additional dependencies beyond the standard twin environment.

## Usage

### Basic Setup

```python
from twin.environmental import EnvironmentalStewardship

# Initialize the system
stewardship = EnvironmentalStewardship(

)
```

### Fuel Consumption

```python
from twin.environmental import FuelType

# Log fuel consumption
stewardship.log_fuel_consumption(
    fuel_type=FuelType.DIESEL,
    quantity_gal=15.0,
    source="main_engine",
    location_lat=58.5,
    location_lon=-157.0,
    engine_hours=1250.5,
)

# Get carbon footprint
footprint = stewardship.get_carbon_footprint()
print(f"CO2 emissions: {footprint.total_co2_lb:.2f} lb")
```

### Waste Disposal

```python
from twin.environmental import WasteType, DisposalMethod

# Log waste disposal
stewardship.log_waste_disposal(
    waste_type=WasteType.OILY_BILGE,
    quantity_lb=50.0,
    disposal_method=DisposalMethod.PORT_FACILITY,
    certification="USCG_CERT_001",
)

# Get waste records
oily_bilge_records = stewardship.get_waste_records(waste_type=WasteType.OILY_BILGE)
```

### Bycatch Monitoring

```python
from twin.environmental import BycatchDisposition

# Log catch for ratio calculation
stewardship.log_catch(5000.0)  # 5000 lb of target catch

# Log bycatch event
stewardship.log_bycatch_event(
    species="Chinook Salmon",
    quantity_lb=15.0,
    disposition=BycatchDisposition.RELEASED_ALIVE,
    release_condition="Good",
)

# Get bycatch summary
summary = stewardship.get_bycatch_summary()
print(f"Survival rate: {summary['survival_rate_percent']:.1f}%")
print(f"Bycatch ratio: {summary['bycatch_ratio_percent']:.2f}%")
```

### Sustainability Metrics

```python
# Calculate all metrics
metrics = stewardship.calculate_sustainability_metrics()

# Check specific metrics
fuel_efficiency = stewardship.get_fuel_efficiency()
emission_intensity = stewardship.get_emission_intensity()
sustainability_score = stewardship.get_sustainability_score()

print(f"Fuel efficiency: {fuel_efficiency:.2f} nm/gal")
print(f"Carbon intensity: {emission_intensity:.3f} lb CO2/nm")
print(f"Sustainability score: {sustainability_score:.1f}/100")
```

### Alerts

```python
# Get environmental alerts
alerts = stewardship.get_alerts()

for alert in alerts:
    print(f"[{alert['severity']}] {alert['code']}")
    print(f"  {alert['message']}")
