## Data Structures

### Core Dataclasses

All data structures include:
- `__post_init__` validation
- `to_dict()` serialization
- `from_dict()` deserialization
- Type hints throughout

1. **SafetyIncident** (17 fields)
2. **EmergencyProtocol** (5 fields)
3. **TrainingRecord** (8 fields)
4. **SafetyDrill** (9 fields)
5. **SafetyEquipment** (8 fields)
6. **PPERecord** (8 fields)

### Enums

All enums support string values for flexibility:

1. **IncidentType** (10 values)
2. **IncidentSeverity** (4 values)
3. **ProtocolType** (5 values)
4. **TrainingType** (8 values)
5. **DrillType** (5 values)
6. **EquipmentType** (9 values)
7. **EquipmentStatus** (4 values)
8. **PPEType** (9 values)
9. **PPECondition** (5 values)

## Persistence

JSONL append-only persistence for all data:

- `incidents.jsonl` - Safety incident records
- `protocols.jsonl` - Emergency protocols
- `training.jsonl` - Training records
- `drills.jsonl` - Safety drill records
- `equipment.jsonl` - Safety equipment records
- `ppe.jsonl` - PPE issuance records

Data is automatically loaded on initialization and persisted on updates.

## Alert System

### Alert Categories

1. **Training Alerts**
   - Critical: Training expired
   - High: Expiring within 7 days
   - Warning: Expiring within 30 days

2. **Equipment Alerts**
   - Critical: Equipment expired
   - High: Equipment expiring within 7 days or unserviceable
   - Warning: Equipment expiring within 30 days

3. **Drill Alerts**
   - High: Drill overdue (90+ days)

4. **Incident Alerts**
   - Critical: Unresolved CRITICAL incident
   - High: Unresolved MAJOR incident

## Integration Points

### 1. TwinCore Integration

```python
# In TwinCore.__init__()
self.safety = CrewSafety(
    vessel_id=self.vessel_id,
    data_dir=data_dir / "safety"
) if enable_safety else None

# In build_snapshot()
if self.safety is not None:
    snap["safety"] = self.safety.to_dict()
```

### 2. MOB Detection Integration

```python
# When MOB is detected
if self.mob.get_active_event():
    mob_event = self.mob.get_active_event()
    self.safety.log_safety_incident(
        incident_type=IncidentType.MOB,
        severity=IncidentSeverity.CRITICAL,
        description=f"MOB detected: {mob_event.crew_member_id}",
        location_lat=mob_event.mob_lat,
        location_lon=mob_event.mob_lon,
        crew_involved=[mob_event.crew_member_id]
    )
```

### 3. WatcherRegistry Integration

```python
# Safety system provides frame for rule evaluation
frame = self.safety.get_watcher_frame()
# Returns: {
#   "total_incidents": 5,
#   "unresolved_incidents": 2,
#   "equipment_issues": 1,
#   "critical_alerts": 1,
#   ...
# }
```

    "Crew member fell overboard",
    location_lat=59.5,
    location_lon=-152.3,
