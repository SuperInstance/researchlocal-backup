```

## Integration with TwinCore

The safety system integrates with TwinCore through several mechanisms:

### 1. MOB Detection Integration

```python
# In TwinCore
if self.mob is not None and self.safety is not None:
    mob_event = self.mob.get_active_event()
    if mob_event:
        # Log MOB as safety incident
        self.safety.log_safety_incident(
            incident_type=IncidentType.MOB,
            severity=IncidentSeverity.CRITICAL,
            description=f"MOB detected: {mob_event.crew_member_id or 'Unknown'}",
            location_lat=mob_event.mob_lat,
            location_lon=mob_event.mob_lon,
            crew_involved=[mob_event.crew_member_id] if mob_event.crew_member_id else []
        )
```

### 2. WatcherRegistry Integration

```python
# Safety system provides watcher frame
watcher_frame = safety.get_watcher_frame()

# Includes:
# - Total incidents and severity counts
# - Unresolved incidents
# - Equipment issues
# - Training expirations
# - Active alerts
```

### 3. Snapshot Integration

```python
# In TwinCore snapshot
snap = {
    # ... other data
    "safety": self.safety.to_dict() if self.safety else None
}
```

## Alert Generation

The system generates alerts for:

### Training Alerts
- **Critical**: Training expired
- **High**: Training expires within 7 days
- **Warning**: Training expires within 30 days

### Equipment Alerts
- **Critical**: Equipment expired
- **High**: Equipment expires within 7 days
- **Warning**: Equipment expires within 30 days
- **High**: Equipment unserviceable

### Drill Alerts
- **High**: Drill overdue (90+ days since last drill)

### Incident Alerts
- **Critical**: Unresolved CRITICAL incident
- **High**: Unresolved MAJOR incident

## Persistence

All data is persisted using JSONL append-only files:

- `incidents.jsonl` - Safety incident records
- `protocols.jsonl` - Emergency protocols
- `training.jsonl` - Training records
- `drills.jsonl` - Safety drill records
- `equipment.jsonl` - Safety equipment records
- `ppe.jsonl` - PPE issuance records

Data is automatically loaded on initialization and persisted on updates.

## Safety Analytics

### Incident Statistics
```python
stats = safety.get_incident_statistics(days=30)
# Returns:
# - Total incidents
# - Breakdown by type and severity
# - Resolution rate
# - Average resolution time
```

### Training Status
```python
expiring = safety.check_training_expiry(days_ahead=30)
# Returns list of training expiring soon
```

### Equipment Status
```python
expiring = safety.check_equipment_expiry(days_ahead=30)
# Returns list of equipment expiring soon

issues = safety.get_safety_equipment(status="UNSERVICEABLE")
# Returns equipment needing attention
```

### Drill Performance
```python
overdue = safety.get_overdue_drills(days_threshold=90)
# Returns list of overdue drills

history = safety.get_drill_history(drill_type=DrillType.MOB_DRILL)
# Returns drill history with scores and performance
```
