## Search & Rescue Coordination

### Search Pattern Generation

The system implements standard IAMSAR (International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue) Manual Vol. 2 search patterns:

#### Expanding Square (VS)

**Use Case:** When datum (last known position) is known with reasonable certainty

**Parameters:**
- Track spacing: 100-500m (typically 100-200m for person in water)
- Initial bearing: Toward datum or downwind
- Maximum legs: 20-40 (adjustable)

**Pattern:**
- Start at datum
- Leg lengths: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4... × track spacing
- Turns: Alternating left/right 90°

**Coverage:** Approximately 4 × (N²) × track_spacing² where N is number of leg pairs

#### Sector Search (VSS)

**Use Case:** When datum is known but search area needs to cover multiple sectors

**Parameters:**
- Track spacing: 100-500m
- Number of sectors: 3-4
- Sector angle: 120° (standard)

**Pattern:**
- Start at datum
- Search 120° sectors
- Radius: 5 × track spacing
- 2 legs per sector (outbound, arc)

**Coverage:** Approximately 3.14 × (5 × track_spacing)² per sector

#### Track Line (TS)

**Use Case:** When known route of travel exists

**Parameters:**
- Track spacing: 100-500m
- Track length: 1000-5000m (based on route)
- Parallel tracks: 5-10

**Pattern:**
- Parallel legs offset by track spacing
- Follow known course line
- Legs can be oriented along or across course

**Coverage:** track_length × (num_tracks × track_spacing)

### Multi-Vessel Coordination

- Equal area assignment when possible
- Vessel capabilities considered (speed, size, equipment)
- Progress tracking per vessel

**Fleet Integration**

## Drift Modeling

### Leeway Drift Model

**Person in Water (PIW)**
- Leeway ratio: 0.15-0.25 of wind speed (typically 0.20)
- Direction: Downwind (opposite to wind from direction)
- Variability: ±30° for uncertainty modeling

**Life Raft**
- Leeway ratio: 0.25-0.35 of wind speed
- Direction: Downwind with less variability
- Higher visibility, larger target

**Debris**
- Leeway ratio: 0.05-0.15 of wind speed
- Direction: Variable based on object type
- Higher uncertainty in modeling

### Current Drift

**Total Drift Calculation**
```
total_drift = current_drift + leeway_drift

Where:
- current_drift: 1.0 × current_speed in current_direction
- leeway_drift: 0.20 × wind_speed in downwind_direction
```

**Vector Addition**
- Current and leeway vectors summed
- Resultant speed and direction calculated
- Confidence ellipse grows with time

### Confidence Radius

**Growth Model**
- Initial radius: 50m (GPS uncertainty)
- Growth rate: 100m per √hour
- Formula: `radius = 50 + 100 × √(time_elapsed_hours)`

**Examples:**
- 1 hour: 150m radius
- 2 hours: 192m radius
- 4 hours: 250m radius
- 8 hours: 333m radius

## Safety Procedures

### Immediate Actions (T-0 to T+5 minutes)

**Bridge Crew**
1. **Hit MOB button** or shout "MAN OVER BOARD"
2. **Point continuously** at MOB position (never lose visual contact)
3. **Throw flotation** (life ring, man overboard module, throwables)
4. **Assign crew** to visual lookout
5. **Log position** and time
6. **Call MAYDAY** on VHF Channel 16
7. **Start engines** (if not already running)
8. **Mark waypoint** on chartplotter

**Deck Crew**
1. **Stop work** immediately
2. **Throw flotation** toward MOB
3. **Alert bridge** (if not already aware)
4. **Assist with lookout** (if safe to do so)
5. **Prepare recovery equipment**

### Search Phase (T+5 to T+60 minutes)

**Vessel Operations**
1. **Return to MOB position** using calculated bearing/course
2. **Initiate search pattern** (expanding square recommended)
3. **Monitor VHF** for responses to MAYDAY
4. **Update drift model** with current weather data
5. **Coordinate with other vessels** (if available)

**Search Pattern Selection**
- **Expanding Square**: Default when position known
- **Sector Search**: When datum uncertain, multiple searchers
- **Track Line**: When route of travel is known

### Recovery Phase

**Approach**
1. **Approach from leeward** (downwind) when possible
2. **Maintain visual contact**
3. **Reduce speed** to minimum steerageway
4. **Assign recovery crew** with proper equipment

**Recovery Techniques**
1. **Life ring retrieval** - Bring MOB to vessel, not vessel to MOB
2. **Jason's Cradle** - Net retrieval system for unconscious victims
3. **Swimming ladder** - Deploy on leeward side
4. **Lift and sling** - Mechanical lifting systems

**Post-Recovery**
1. **Assess medical condition** - Hypothermia, injuries, drowning
2. **Provide first aid** - CPR if needed, treat hypothermia
4. **Log event** - Complete incident report
5. **Cancel distress** - Inform Coast Guard of outcome
