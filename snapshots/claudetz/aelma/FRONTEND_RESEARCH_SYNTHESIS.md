# AELMA Frontend R&D Research Synthesis
## Marine Digital Twin Interface Development Strategy

**Research Date:** 2026-07-28
**Status:** Complete - Ready for Implementation
**Deliverable:** Comprehensive frontend architecture and implementation roadmap

---

## Executive Summary

Three research tracks were executed in parallel to inform AELMA frontend development:

1. **Marine Digital Twin UX Patterns** - Analysis of commercial marine systems and regulatory standards
2. **Kimi Integration Analysis** - AI-assisted frontend development capabilities
3. **DAW Timeline Interface Research** - Multi-track temporal data visualization

**Key Finding:** AELMA can leap-frog existing marine systems by applying modern web development best practices while respecting maritime regulatory requirements and environmental constraints.

---

## Research Track 1: Marine Digital Twin UX Patterns

### Critical Discovery: Commercial Systems Lag Modern Standards

**Industry Assessment:**
- Marine electronics lag consumer technology by **5-10 years** in UX design
- Commercial systems (Garmin, Simrad, Raymarine) score poorly on modern UI/UX standards
- Critical gaps: touch interface fails with water, poor sunlight readability, complex menu structures

**Regulatory Requirements (Maritime Standards):**
- **Touch target size:** Minimum 15mm (maritime regulation) vs 44px (Apple standard)
- **Recommended:** 20mm targets for wet/gloved operation
- **Display modes:** High-contrast day mode + red-preserving night mode
- **Fail-safe design:** Physical buttons for critical functions

### Three-Viewer Architecture Specification

**Viewer 1: Markdown IDE** (Text-Based Log/Terminal)
```
Purpose: Command center for vessel agent interactions

Components:
- Monaco Editor (VS Code's editor) for Markdown editing
- xterm.js for terminal/NMEA stream display
- Split-pane: Edit | Preview | Terminal
- Voice-first STT/TTS interface for wet-environment operation
```

**Viewer 2: DAW Timeline** (Horizontal Tracks with Time-Based Data)
```
Purpose: Multi-track temporal visualization of vessel telemetry

Tracks (Marine Adaptation):
- Audio Track → Data Stream Track (NMEA, depth, speed)
- MIDI Clip → Event Group (alerts, operations)
- Automation Lane → Threshold/State Lane (equipment parameters)
- Waveform → Data Visualization (line charts, summaries)

Tech Stack: D3.js (framework) + Canvas API (performance)
Performance Targets: <16ms render time (60 FPS), <50ms scrub latency
```

**Viewer 3: Spatial Chart** (2D/3D Map with Vessel Position)
```
Purpose: Bird's-eye view of fishing grounds with bathymetry

Recommendation: CesiumJS (Primary) + MapLibre GL JS (Backup)
Why CesiumJS:
- Built-in Cesium World Bathymetry
- Marine-specific features (3D ocean visualization)
- GPU-accelerated WebGL rendering
- Free and open-source

Key Features:
- Bathymetry visualization (depth-based coloring)
- H3 hexagonal grid overlay
- Vessel trajectory with time-based color gradient
- Biomass heatmap overlay
- Catch event markers
```

### Tech Stack Recommendations

**Framework: React + TypeScript**
- Largest ecosystem of visualization libraries
- Performance optimizations (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- First-class TypeScript integration for type safety

**Mapping: CesiumJS**
- 3D globe with bathymetry
- Marine-specific features
- Superior to Mapbox/Leaflet for ocean visualization

**Real-Time Charting: D3.js (Primary) + Plotly.js (Scientific)**
- D3.js: Timeline tracks, acoustic waveforms (full control)
- Plotly.js: Species classification, statistical analysis
- Canvas API: Acoustic echogram rendering (15Hz update rate)

## Research Track 2: Kimi Integration Analysis

### Kimi K3 Capabilities Assessment

**Key Finding:** Kimi K3 is **#1 ranked in Frontend Code Arena** with specific advantages for AELMA:

**Core Strengths:**
- **1M token context window** - Can understand entire AELMA codebase (21KB viewer + all dependencies)
- **#1 Frontend AI** - Top-ranked for React/TypeScript/Three.js
- **Three.js expertise** - Demonstrated WebGPU 3D game demo
- **Streaming API** - Real-time dashboard capabilities
- **Cost effective** - "Unlimited sessions at zero marginal cost"

**vs Competitors:**
| **Aspect** | **Kimi K3** | **Claude** | **GitHub Copilot** |
|------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Frontend rank** | #1 | Strong but not top-ranked | Good but inconsistent |
| **Context window** | 1M tokens | 200K tokens | Limited to open files |
| **Three.js expertise** | Demonstrated WebGPU demo | Strong but less specialized | Basic support |
| **Cost** | Free/low-cost | Higher per-token costs | Subscription ($10-20/month) |

**Verdict:** Kimi K3 wins on **frontend code quality, cost, and long-context** for large codebases like AELMA.

**IDE Support:** GitHub Copilot
- Rapid inline code completion
- Boilerplate generation
- Function signature suggestions

### Specific Kimi Prompts for AELMA

**Prompt 1: Code Review**
```
Review this AELMA marine digital twin viewer code (app.js, 21KB Three.js + WebSocket).
Focus on:
1. Three.js performance optimization (bathymetry rendering, point clouds)
2. WebSocket reliability (reconnect logic, message handling)
3. Memory management (geometry reuse, buffer optimization)
4. iPad/mobile responsiveness (touch events, layout)

Provide specific code improvements with explanations.
```

**Prompt 2: Component Modularization**
```
Refactor this AELMA viewer code into TypeScript modules:
1. VesselScene.ts - Three.js scene setup, vessel rendering, bathymetry
2. TelemetryPanel.ts - Sidebar UI, depth display, channel grid
3. AlertSystem.ts - Alert management, history, notifications
4. WebSocketClient.ts - WS connection, reconnection, message handling

Use type-safe interfaces for VesselStateSnapshot data structure.
```

- **Hybrid approach** for optimal balance

**Performance Targets:**
- **Render Time:** <16ms (60 FPS)
- **Scrub Latency:** <50ms
- **Clip Loading:** <100ms per 1000 clips

**Data Management:**
- Circular buffers for real-time data (10,000 points rolling)
- Level-of-detail (LOD) rendering based on zoom
- Data decimation for zoomed-out views
- Web Workers for data processing

### Integration Architecture

**Data Flow:**
```
Bridge (NMEA) → Twin (State) → Timeline (UI)
                      ↓
              WebSocket Channel
