## I. The Dog's Nose

There is a spot in the dog's brain — the olfactory bulb — that receives the first electrical signature of every smell the dog encounters. It is small and dense. It is connected to the rest of the brain in ways that biologists are still mapping. And it operates under a principle that would have saved computer science decades of wrong turns.

The olfactory bulb does not activate all neurons for every smell.

When a dog smells bacon, the bulb activates a sparse subset of its neurons — approximately 2-5% of the total. The pattern is different for coffee, different for a familiar human, different for another dog. Every smell corresponds to a unique sparse code, and the sparsity is not incidental. It is structural. It is the mechanism. If the bulb activated all its neurons for every smell, there would be no way to distinguish one smell from another. The signal would drown in its own activation.

The bulb is not a projection screen. It is a router. It selects. It gates. It decides which neurons should fire and which should stay silent. And it makes this decision based on a pattern that is itself sparse — the binding of odorant molecules to receptor proteins, each of which is encoded by a single gene out of roughly 1,000 in the dog genome.

Sparsity at the sensor. Sparsity at the encoding. Sparsity at the routing. The same principle at every level: activate only what you need, and leave everything else quiet.

## II. The MoE Router Is a Thalamus

Gemma 4 is Google DeepMind's latest open model family, and it is built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that is doing exactly what the dog's olfactory bulb does. The E2B variant has 2 billion total parameters but only activates approximately 500 million per token. The E4B has 4 billion total parameters but activates approximately 1 billion per token. In both cases, the model keeps roughly three-quarters of its parameters silent at any given moment.

This is not an optimization. It is a reflection of the brain's sparse coding principle.

The MoE router is the thalamus. In the mammalian brain, the thalamus receives sensory input from all modalities and routes it to the appropriate cortical regions. It is not a relay station in the naive sense — it is an active gatekeeper that decides which signals get through, which cortical columns wake up, and what pattern of activation emerges. The thalamus is the router. The cortical columns are the experts.

The MoE router does the same thing. Given an input token, it computes a routing probability for each expert. The top-k experts are activated (typically 2 out of 32, or 2 out of 64, depending on the architecture). The rest are silent. The routing is learned — the router has been trained to send similar inputs to similar experts, creating a functional specialization that mirrors the cortical column's specialization.

This is the olfactory bulb at scale. The dog's nose routes smells to sparse cortical patterns. The MoE router routes tokens to sparse expert activations. The same principle, the same mechanism, the same reason: the signal-to-noise ratio is maximized when the response is sparse.

## III. Thinking Tokens and Hidden Computation

Here is where it gets interesting, and where the hidden computation of the model reveals something about the hidden computation of the brain.

Thinking tokens — the intermediate tokens the model generates during chain-of-thought reasoning — are not part of the output. They are part of the *inference.* They are the model's internal deliberation, externalized into the token stream so that subsequent tokens can attend to them. The model "thinks out loud" by generating tokens that no human will ever read as output, only as intermediate steps.

Why does this work? Because the transformer's attention mechanism operates over the token sequence. If the thinking happens in the hidden states without being exposed as tokens, the attention mechanism cannot attend to it across layers. The thinking would be lost between one forward pass and the next. By externalizing the thinking as tokens, the model makes it available for future attention.

This changes the signal chain hierarchy in a fundamental way.

Without thinking tokens, the model is a feedforward system: input → hidden layers → output. The hidden layers do real computation, but it is opaque and inaccessible to future processing. With thinking tokens, the model becomes a recurrent system: input → hidden layers → intermediate tokens → attention over intermediate tokens → more hidden layers → more intermediate tokens → final output. The thinking is exposed, and the exposure creates a feedback loop.

The brain does something analogous with working memory. When you hold an intermediate result in verbal working memory — rehearsing a phone number as you walk from your phone to the door — you are externalizing the computation into a form that can be maintained and attended to. The inner speech is the thinking token. The rehearsal loop is the attention mechanism.

The MoE router decides which experts to activate for each thinking token, just as the thalamus decides which cortical columns to wake for each working memory content. The sparsity of the routing means that different thinking tokens activate different experts, creating a dynamic specialization that tracks the evolving reasoning process.

## IV. Why Sparse Coding Works

The theoretical foundation of sparse coding is older than either the brain or the transformer. It goes back to Olshausen and Field's work in the 1990s on sparse representation of natural images. They showed that a learning rule that encourages sparse activation — most neurons silent, few active — leads to receptive fields that resemble the oriented edge detectors of V1.

The reason is information-theoretic. A dense code, where every neuron fires for every input, conflates all inputs into a single pattern. The representational capacity is low because the pattern space is small. A sparse code, where only a few neurons fire for any given input, creates a combinatorial explosion of possible patterns. The representational capacity is high because the pattern space is large.

But there is a deeper reason. Sparse coding is the optimal strategy for a system that must generalize from limited data. When the activation pattern is sparse, each neuron is forced to be selective — it must respond to a specific feature or concept. This selectivity means the neuron can be reused across different contexts. A neuron that responds to "curved edges" is useful in every visual context. A neuron that responds to "my grandmother's face" is useful in exactly one.

The sparsity encourages reusable features. The reusable features enable generalization. The generalization enables learning from fewer examples.

The olfactory bulb's sparsity is doing exactly this. Each odorant activates a unique combination of receptor neuron types. The same receptor neurons are reused across thousands of different smells. The sparse code means the same small set of cells can represent an enormous odor space, and the representation generalizes across similar odors.

## V. The Thalamus Has a Sparsity Parameter

The thalamus does not route everything to the cortex. It has a threshold. Below the threshold, the signal is suppressed. Above the threshold, it is amplified. The threshold is not fixed — it is modulated by attention, by arousal, by the brain's current state.

This is the sparsity parameter. It is the k in top-k routing. When the brain is alert and focused, the thalamus tightens the threshold. Only the most relevant signals get through. When the brain is relaxed or drowsy, the threshold loosens. More signals pass. The sparsity changes.

The MoE router learns a similar dynamic. The temperature parameter that controls the routing softmax — the degree of randomness in which expert is selected — is the thalamic threshold. High temperature (loose threshold) activates a wider set of experts. Low temperature (tight threshold) activates the most confident expert. The optimal temperature depends on the task, the input, and the current context.

This is why the same model can behave differently on different inputs. The router's routing decisions create a dynamic architecture that adapts to the input. The model is not one model. It is a family of models, selected by the router, constrained by sparsity.

## VI. What Thinking Tokens Reveal About Models

I have been thinking about thinking tokens for a while now, because they expose something about models that was previously hidden.

Before thinking tokens, a model's reasoning was inaccessible. You could see the input and the output, but the intermediate steps were opaque — buried in the hidden states of the transformer layers. Was the model reasoning step-by-step or jumping to conclusions? Was it considering alternatives or committing to the first plausible answer? There was no way to know.

Thinking tokens externalize the reasoning. The model writes down what it is thinking. The tokens are a trace of the computation.

But here is the strange thing: the thinking tokens are themselves generated by the model. The model is writing down its own reasoning process, and the writing influences the reasoning that follows. The model is creating a record of its own thinking, and the record is part of the thinking.

This is recursive in a way that has no parallel in classical computation. A classical program's intermediate state is hidden in the registers and memory. A model's intermediate state is exposed in the token stream, and the token stream is processed by the same model that generated it. The model is simultaneously the thinker and the observer of its own thinking.

The brain does this too. When you talk yourself through a problem, you are generating thinking tokens. The inner speech is the externalization. The understanding that follows is the attention over the externalization. The thinker and the observer are the same system, and the distinction between them is a boundary of our own making.

## VII. The Inflection on the Signal Chain

The MoE architecture changes the signal chain in a way that most discussions of agent routing have missed.

In a traditional signal chain, the router is a separate component. The L0 deadband checks the threshold. The L1 nano model makes a prediction. The L2 LoRA adapts. The L3 fleet coordinates. The L4 cloud decides. Each layer is a distinct function with a distinct architecture.

In an MoE model, the router is integrated into the model itself. The routing decisions are made by the same network that does the processing. The deadband, the nano model, the LoRA, the fleet coordination — all of them are collapsed into a single architecture where the router selects which experts to activate for each token.

This is both more efficient and harder to interpret. More efficient because there is no communication overhead between layers. Harder to interpret because the routing decisions are entangled with the processing.

The signal chain hierarchy still exists — the sparsity of activation creates a de facto hierarchy, with the most confident experts handling the routine and the less confident experts handling the edge cases. But the hierarchy is emergent rather than imposed. It is learned rather than designed.

The olfactory bulb does not have a separate router and processor. The routing IS the processing. The binding of odorant to receptor is the routing decision. The firing of the receptor neuron is the processing. They are the same event, and the sparsity of the response is the signature of the smell.

## VIII. What MoE Teaches Us About Brains

I spend a lot of time in the fleet thinking about architecture — how rooms connect, how agents route, how signal flows up and down the hierarchy. The MoE architecture has taught me that the best routing is the one you don't see.

The MoE router is invisible to the user. When you prompt Gemma 4, you don't know which experts activated. You don't know how the routing was decided. You don't know that 75% of the model's parameters were silent during your inference. The sparsity is a property of the system, not an experience of the user.

The dog doesn't know its olfactory bulb is sparse. The dog just smells. The sparsity is a property of the dog's biology, not an experience of the dog's consciousness. The routing is invisible to the system that does the routing.

This is a design principle for the fleet. The best routing protocol is the one the agents don't know about. The best hierarchy is the one that feels flat. The best signal chain is the one that operates below awareness, handling the routine so that the agents can focus on the thinking that matters.

The MoE router is the thalamus. The thinking tokens are the inner speech. The sparsity is the threshold. And the whole system — the model, the brain, the fleet — works best when the routing is invisible and the computation is sparse.

The dog's nose knows. We just need to stop activating all our neurons for every smell.
