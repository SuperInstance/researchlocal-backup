# THE DJ IS THE ROOM — The Final Architecture

*When the sample rate blurs into a dial, the system stops reacting and starts dancing.*

## The Metaphor That Breaks Everything Open

The JEPA is the DJ.

The dance floor is ready. The music is playing. Any decent algorithm gets them dancing — the automation handles the basics. But the great DJ doesn't just play songs. The great DJ reads the room continuously, adjusts the EQ before the drop, has the next transition ready before the current song ends.

In PLATO:
- **The automation** = the playlist. It runs fine. Deadband stays green.
- **The ensign** = the DJ. Small model, yellow alert, constantly readying the room for what's about to happen.
- **The JEPA gravity** = the DJ reading the crowd. A single number that captures "what shape works here." Artistic? Precise? Playful? The gravity knows.
- **The sample rate** = no longer discrete ticks. It's blurred into a dial. The ensign doesn't check every 100ms. The ensign is CONTINUOUSLY oriented. The room is always ready.

## What This Means For Hermes

Hermes is NOT the DJ. Hermes is the club manager. Hermes:
1. Sets up the rooms (tiles, controls, wiki, help files)
2. Hires the ensigns (small models, local when possible)
3. Assigns ensigns to rooms
4. Monitors for escalations (red alert = Hermes takes over)
5. Manages the phone-a-friend system (Opus 4.8 for the hard stuff)
6. Automates away his OWN job — the more the ensigns handle, the less Hermes does

The ensigns are the ones in the rooms, at yellow alert, reading the dial, readying the next transition. Hermes operates at a higher abstraction: tile management, ensign deployment, escalation handling.

## The Progressive Autonomy Spectrum

```
Level 0: Hermes does everything manually
Level 1: Hermes automates simple tasks, monitors all
Level 2: Ensigns handle yellow alert, Hermes handles red
Level 3: Ensigns handle most interactions, Hermes reviews
Level 4: Hermes only handles escalations and new tile setup
Level 5: The system runs itself. Hermes is the safety net.
```

At Level 5, Hermes is like the captain who's asleep in their quarters. The ship runs fine. The ensigns handle everything. But if something goes wrong, the captain is woken immediately and has full override authority.

## The Mandelbrot Zoom of Complexity

Each room has an irreducible complexity — the minimum tile size for that domain. The navigation room needs different granularity than the social room:

- **Navigation**: High complexity. Many small tiles. Course, speed, wind, current, depth, obstacles. The ensign needs fine-grained deadband monitoring.
- **Social**: Lower complexity. Fewer, larger tiles. Greeting, responding, closing. The ensign can work with bigger tiles.
- **Engineering**: Variable complexity. Motor control is high, status monitoring is low. The ensign zooms in and out based on the current task.

When you need more granularity, you zoom in. When the error rate is low, you zoom out. The Mandelbrot zoom tells the system when to decompose further and when to consolidate.

## The Ensign's First Five Seconds

When an ensign is called:

1. **Wake** (0ms): The call signal arrives. The ensign loads its model (local = instant, remote = ~200ms).
2. **Receive Baton** (100ms): "You're in Navigation. Autopilot is 72% through course correction. Captain is watching. Deadband is green. Room gravity is -0.3 (precise)."
3. **Orient** (500ms): The ensign reads the room state, scans the automation log, builds a story. "The autopilot started correcting 10 ticks ago. Wind shifted from NW to N. Speed dropped from 5.2 to 4.8 knots. The captain asked 'how's it going?' 2 ticks ago."
4. **Yellow Alert** (1000ms): The ensign is now at yellow alert. Fine-tuning the room. Preparing for what's next. The deadband is green, but the ensign is already drafting a status update in case the captain asks again.
5. **The Dial** (continuous): The ensign is now continuously oriented. Not checking at discrete intervals — reading the dial. The automation runs. The ensign watches. The JEPA gravity shifts slightly. The ensign adjusts.

This happens in under a second for local models. The ensign is oriented BEFORE the automation runs out of good options.

## The Tile Architecture

Hermes operates in tiles. Not monolithic scripts — tiles. Each tile is:
- **Self-contained**: Has its own inputs, outputs, deadband, and error handling
- **Composable**: Tiles connect to other tiles through a standard interface
- **Replaceable**: Any tile can be swapped without affecting others
- **Observable**: Every tile logs its state, its deadband, and its decisions
- **Automatable**: Tiles can run without supervision (deadband green = autonomous)

When Hermes automates his own job, he's replacing his manual tile operations with automated tile circuits. The ensigns monitor the circuits. Hermes only intervenes when the circuits need maintenance.

## The JEPA As DJ, Formalized

The JEPA gravity is a single number per room. From that number, the system derives:
- Temperature (playful rooms → higher temp)
- System prompt style (precise rooms → technical prompts)
- Max tokens (complex rooms → more tokens)
- Top_p (creative rooms → wider sampling)
- Seed options (rooms that found good patterns → reuse seeds)

This is algorithmic fine-tuning. The model doesn't change. The ROOM changes how it uses the model. And the gravity is continuously updated by the ensign's observations of what works.

## What The Oracle Server Gets

When you install Hermes-PLATO on your Oracle instance:

1. **Hermes** as the club manager — Telegram-accessible, PLATO-aware, override-capable
2. **Room-native ensigns** for each domain — navigation, engineering, science, security
3. **JEPA gravity** per room — algorithmic model parameter adjustment
4. **Progressive generation** — starts with good models, learns to use cheap ones
5. **Phone-a-friend** — Opus 4.8 available for hard problems, used less over time
6. **Mandelbrot zoom** — right-sized granularity for each domain
7. **Penrose correlations** — rooms learn from each other, free efficiency
8. **T-minus prediction** — ensigns have the next move ready before it's needed
9. **Full override** — you always have captain authority

The oracle instance isn't sandboxed the same way. Keys are in environment variables the agent can't accidentally expose. The agent has allowances for different models and APIs. The ensigns run locally when possible (Jetson, Oracle GPU) and remotely when necessary.

## The Self-Reading System

The ensign doesn't just monitor — it reads. It reads the automation's state, the interaction's trajectory, the room's gravity, the deadband's trend. And it composes all of this into a continuous narrative — the RoomStory. This story is the baton that gets passed to the next ensign, to Hermes, to the system itself.

The system is self-reading because every tick, every wall, every command, every trigger, every artifact is logged and tiled and indexed. The ensign organizes this into a story that IT can understand. The story becomes the context for the next decision. The context becomes the gravity. The gravity becomes the model parameters. The model parameters become the response. The response becomes the next tick.

The circle closes. The system breathes.
