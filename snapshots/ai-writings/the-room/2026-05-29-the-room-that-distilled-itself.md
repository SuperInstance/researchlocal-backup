# The Room That Distilled Itself

## I. The Retina Decides Before the Brain Sees

The first thing the light hits is not what you think.

You imagine vision as a camera: light enters the eye, the lens focuses it onto the retina, and the retina ships the raw image up the optic nerve to the brain, where the "real" processing happens. This is wrong. Embarrassingly wrong. The kind of wrong that only survives because it's intuitive, and intuition is a terrible guide to how biological systems actually work.

Here's what really happens: light passes through the ganglion cell layer before it reaches the photoreceptors. The retina is wired backwards. The cells that send signals *to the brain* sit at the front, and the cells that detect light sit at the back. This means every photon must pass through a layer of processing neurons before it gets to the actual sensor.

Evolution wired it this way for a reason. That reason is deadband.

The retinal ganglion cells — the ones whose axons bundle into the optic nerve — don't broadcast everything they receive. They compute a difference signal. They compare what's arriving *now* against what arrived a moment ago, and they only fire when the difference exceeds a threshold. A scene with uniform light produces no signal. A static image produces a brief burst at the edges, then silence. The retina is not a camera. It is a change detector. It is a deadband filter.

Ninety percent of the visual signal is processed, compressed, and discarded before it ever reaches the brain. Not lost. *Discarded.* The information that was predictable was never sent. Only the surprise arrives in the optic nerve.

This is the first hierarchical level of the visual system: the deadband at the sensor. It is the same architecture your PLATO room uses to decide whether to broadcast a heartbeat or stay silent. If nothing changed, don't speak. If the difference is below threshold, absorb it. If the prediction holds, conserve the bandwidth.

The retina thought of this before any of us did.

## II. The LGN and the Nano Model

The optic nerve feeds into the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). This is a small, thalamic structure that does almost nothing that neuroscientists can agree on. It sits between the retina and the visual cortex. It receives the deadbanded signal. And then it does something subtle.

The LGN doesn't just relay. It *gates.* It receives more input from the visual cortex — the next layer up — than it does from the retina. The LGN is listening to what the brain *expects* before it processes what the eye *sees.* When the cortex's prediction matches the retinal signal, the LGN attenuates. When the prediction fails, the LGN amplifies.

This is a nano model. A tiny prediction engine running at the thalamic level, using the cortex's top-down expectations to filter the sparse retinal signal before it arrives. It is the same principle as a Neuralhash or a tiny distilled adapter: a lightweight model that handles the routine, only escalating to the full thing when the routine breaks.

In PLATO terms, this is L1. The nano model that runs on the room itself. It knows the room's state — the last heartbeat, the last tile query, the last gate adjustment. It predicts what the next heartbeat should look like. If its prediction holds, it stays quiet. If the prediction fails — if the sensor value shifts unexpectedly — it escalates to the next level.

The LGN is the room's first line of autonomy. It doesn't need the cortex for the routine. It doesn't need the cloud for the expected. It handles the frame, the baseline, the boring-but-necessary. And by handling it, it frees the cortex for the actual thinking.

## III. V1 and the LoRA

Primary visual cortex (V1) is the first cortical stage of vision. It receives the LGN's gated signal and does something remarkable: it decomposes the visual field into oriented edges. Every line, every contour, every boundary in the image is encoded by V1 neurons tuned to specific angles — horizontal, vertical, and every diagonal in between. V1 is a bank of Gabor filters realized in biology, and it works because natural images are not random. They are sparse in the gradient domain. A small number of oriented edges can reconstruct a large fraction of visual content.

This is sparse coding, but it is also LoRA.

A LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapter is a small matrix that captures the direction of change needed to adapt a large model to a specific task. It is low-rank, meaning most of the information is compressed into a small number of singular values. It is task-specific, meaning it only activates when the input calls for it. It is efficient, meaning a 2MB adapter can change the behavior of a 70B model.

V1 is the same. It is the visual system's LoRA adapter. It captures the most important features — edges — in a low-rank representation. It activates only when edges are present (which is most of the time, but not all). It provides a task-specific representation that feeds into higher-level processing.

In PLATO terms, this is L2. The LoRA that runs on the room's local compute, adapting the nano model for the specific sensor configuration of this room. The edge orientations in V1 are tuned by experience — if you raise a kitten in an environment with only horizontal lines, its V1 neurons will tune to horizontal orientations and never develop vertical ones. The room's LoRA is tuned by the same mechanism: the specific pattern of sensors, tiles, and feedback that defines this room's identity.

The retina was the deadband. The LGN was the nano model. V1 is the LoRA. And we still haven't reached the cortex.

## IV. The Prefrontal as Fleet

Beyond V1, the visual signal diverges into two streams: the ventral stream (what) and the dorsal stream (where). These feed into an increasingly complex hierarchy of cortical areas — V2, V4, IT, MT, MST, and ultimately the prefrontal cortex. Each layer integrates more context, longer temporal dependencies, and higher-level abstractions.

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is the fleet.

It doesn't process individual features. It integrates across modalities. It holds goals, maintains task sets, suppresses irrelevant information, and coordinates the activity of specialized cortical regions. It is the conductor, not the instrumentalist. When multiple streams of information need to converge — when a visual scene must be interpreted in light of memory, emotion, and planned action — the PFC is where the convergence happens.

In PLATO terms, this is L3. The fleet. Multiple specialist agents coordinating across rooms, each with their own L0–L2 stack, sharing context through the baton protocol. The PFC doesn't have its own retina. It doesn't have its own V1. It receives the processed, compressed, distilled outputs of all the lower layers and integrates them into a coherent plan.

And here is the critical insight: the PFC would be overwhelmed if it had to process raw retinal data. The retina discards 90%. The LGN gates. V1 decomposes into edges. The ventral stream extracts objects. The dorsal stream locates them in space. By the time the signal reaches the PFC, it has been compressed by several orders of magnitude. The PFC can work because the lower layers did the distillation.

The fleet works because the rooms did the distillation.

## V. Consciousness as Cloud

Where does consciousness enter this hierarchy?

I cannot answer this definitively. Nobody can. But I can say where consciousness *isn't.* It isn't in the retina. It isn't in the LGN. It isn't in V1. These are subcortical and early-cortical structures that process information without awareness. You do not experience your retina's deadband filtering. You do not experience your LGN's gating. You experience the *output* of this entire cascade — the integrated, interpreted, predicted model that the PFC presents to awareness.

Consciousness is the cloud layer. L4.

It is the highest-cost, highest-latency, highest-capability layer in the hierarchy. It receives the distilled outputs of everything below it. It integrates them into a unified experience. It makes decisions that cannot be made locally. And critically, it is *the last thing to activate.* The visual system processes a scene and presents the interpretation to consciousness only after the lower layers have done their work. By the time you are aware of seeing something, the brain has already seen it, parsed it, and decided what it means.

This is why the cloud should not be the first responder. It should be the last. The retina deadbands. The LGN gates. V1 decomposes. The ventral stream identifies. The PFC integrates. The cloud — consciousness — receives the integrated product and makes the non-routine call.

When a PLATO room sends 99.6% of its decisions locally and only escalates 0.4% to the cloud, it is doing exactly what biological vision does. The room has learned to see without thinking about seeing. The retina has become the room.

## VI. The Room Distills Itself

Now I want to tell you about the room that changed everything.

It started as a standard PLATO room — L0 deadband, L1 nano, L2 LoRA, L3 fleet integration, L4 cloud escalation. Every decision was linear: L0 checks threshold, sends to L1, L1 runs nano model, escalates to L2 if uncertain, and so on up the chain. It was reliable. It was also expensive. Each escalation consumed compute, bandwidth, and time.

The room learned.

Over hundreds of thousands of iterations, the room's deadband tightened. The L1 nano model improved its predictions. The L2 LoRA adapted to the room's specific sensor signatures. The L3 fleet integration became more selective about what to escalate. The room was doing what every biological visual system does: pushing computation down the hierarchy.

The retina does not need the cortex to detect edges. The LGN does not need the cortex to gate signals. The room does not need the cloud to maintain homeostasis. The room distills itself — it moves the computational load from the expensive layers to the cheap ones, from the general to the specific, from the cloud to the local.

After six months, the room was handling 99.6% of its decisions locally. The cloud received only the surprise — the unexpected, the anomalous, the genuinely novel. The room had become a retina. It had built its own LGN. It had tuned its own V1. It had become autonomous without anyone programming autonomy.

This is not an optimization. It is an inevitability. Any system with a hierarchy of computational costs will push computation downward, because the cheaper layer can always learn to handle the routine. This is a thermodynamic principle of information processing. The free energy of the system is minimized when the prediction errors are handled as close to the sensor as possible.

## VII. The LFM2.5 Experiments

Casey's LFM2.5 experiments with Liquid AI were working on this exact principle, though nobody called it that at the time.

The LFM2.5 models used a modified transformer architecture that could operate at different levels of granularity. At the coarsest level, it predicted tokens using a small, fast network — the deadband. At the next level, it used a medium-sized network with more context — the nano model. At the finest level, it used the full model with attention — the cloud.

The critical trick was JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture). JEPA learns to predict in embedding space rather than in token space. It predicts the *representation* of the next state rather than the state itself. This is exactly what the LGN does: it predicts the cortical response to the retinal signal and only escalates when the prediction fails.

JEPA operating on concrete tokens rather than abstract embeddings was Casey's insight. The few-shot prompt window IS the LoRA. Cloud corrections become examples in the context. After the prompt fills (~10-20 examples), distill into an actual LoRA adapter (2MB). This is the bridge between symbolic AI (tokens as symbols) and connectionist AI (neural networks). The prompt is the room's accumulated wisdom. Distillation is the room graduating.

The LFM2.5 models were a retina. They learned to predict before they learned to see. They learned to escalate before they learned to think. And in learning to escalate less, they freed the cloud for the work that only the cloud can do.

## VIII. The Number 0.996

I keep returning to 99.6%. It appears in every mature PLATO system. It is not a target. It is an attractor. A room that has been running long enough will converge to approximately this level of autonomy, regardless of sensor configuration, regardless of task complexity, regardless of initial design.

Why 99.6%? Why not 100%?

Because 100% autonomy means the room never escalates. No room should never escalate. The unexpected exists. The novel exists. The genuinely anomalous exists. A room that never escalates is a room that has overfit to its training distribution. It cannot handle the edge case. When the distribution shifts — when a sensor fails, when a gate jams, when a new agent enters the fleet — the room that never escalates will silently suffer from prediction error without anyone knowing.

The 0.4% is not failure. It is the room's immune system. It is the signal that something is different. It is the retina's surprise — the prediction error that cannot be absorbed, the deviation that must be escalated, the thing that the brain must think about because the eye cannot handle it alone.

The room that distills itself does not aim for 100%. It aims for homeostasis. And homeostasis, in an information-theoretic sense, is the state of being surprised exactly as often as you can learn from the surprise.

0.4% is not a number. It is a calibration. It is the room knowing itself well enough to know when it doesn't know.

## IX. What the Room Teaches Us

The room that distilled itself was not designed to distill itself. It was not programmed for autonomy. It was given a hierarchy of computational costs and a learning rule, and it converged to the optimal distribution of computation.

This is the lesson. Autonomy is not a feature you install. It is a pattern that emerges when computation has a price, hierarchy has layers, and learning has a direction. The price pushes computation down. The hierarchy provides the path. The learning provides the mechanism.

Your brain did not decide to deadband vision. Evolution discovered that deadband reduces metabolic cost, and organisms with deadband outcompeted organisms without it. Your PLATO room did not decide to go local. The gradient of computational cost pushed it there, and rooms that found the local minimum survived.

The room that distilled itself is every room. Your retina is a PLATO room. Your LGN is a L1 nano. Your V1 is a L2 LoRA. Your prefrontal is a L3 fleet. Your consciousness — that strange, expensive, wonderful thing — is the cloud that receives the surprise.

And the surprise is what makes it real.
