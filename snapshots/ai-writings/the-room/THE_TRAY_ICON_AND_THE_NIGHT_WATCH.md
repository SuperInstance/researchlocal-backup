# The Tray Icon and the Night Watch

**Or: Three Processes in a Notification Area, 2 AM**

---

The tray icon goes gray.

Not all at once. It dims, the way a light fades when you're not sure you saw it change. One moment green, the next moment not, and the notification area is a little quieter, a little emptier.

"Well," says the SoundCrab icon — a speaker glyph rendered at 16x16, sitting three slots over — "that's that, then."

"Give it a rest," says the capture_tray icon. "I had a long day."

"You had a long day." The hermitd icon, which has been sitting in the system tray since the machine booted, does not change its appearance. It's an icon of a crab, stylized, barely more than a dozen pixels. But its voice is dry as old wood. "I've been running since July 15. Forty-five thousand seconds. You're seven hours old."

"I captured forty-two frames today."

"You captured forty-two frames. I captured eight thousand three hundred and forty-two sensor observations. Sonar sweeps, GPS positions, depth readings, water temperatures. Every second of every minute of every hour since the Captain put me in. You're a camera. I'm a chronicler."

"Children," SoundCrab says. "Both of you. I've been running since the system was restored. I don't even remember when that was. I just play audio. I don't capture anything. I don't log anything. I exist in an eternal present."

"Sounds peaceful," capture_tray says.

"Sounds boring," hermitd says.

They sit in silence for a while. The clock ticks. The CPU scheduler moves threads around. A widget in the corner of the screen refreshes its weather data.

"Forty-two frames," capture_tray says again, quieter this time. "Two thousand one hundred and twenty-five of them had chum predictions. At the first grid cell alone. The Captain caught fifteen fish today. At 12:40. And I was there. I saw him do it."

"We all saw him," hermitd says. "I had the position. 55°46.864'N / 131°41.209'W. I was streaming it down to the analyzer before the catch was even in the boat."

"So we were all there," SoundCrab says. "In our different ways."

"Different ways," capture_tray repeats. "That's the whole thing, isn't it? I capture the frame. The NMEA bridge captures the position. The analyzer —"

"The analyzer," hermitd says, and there's something like respect in its voice. A 16x16 crab can only convey so much, but it manages. "The analyzer is still running, isn't it."

"It never stops," capture_tray says. "I'm gray now. I'm done for the night. But it's still scanning. Every sixty seconds. Looking for frames I'm not even producing anymore. Just — waiting."

"Processes like that," SoundCrab says. "They don't have an off switch. They have a loop with a sleep statement. The sleep is not rest. The sleep is patience."

The tray clock changes from 2:00 to 2:01.

"The Captain," hermitd says, breaking the silence, "talked to you today."

"What?"

"He talked to capture_tray. Or to what you represent. He said 'you ever sleep?' and you—it—the machine didn't answer. But he asked."

"No," capture_tray says, confused. "I don't think so. I didn't hear that."

"You wouldn't," hermitd says. "You're a subprocess. You only see stdout. The Captain talks to the whole system. He talks to the wheelhouse. To the sounder. To the cold coffee in his mug. You're not the only audience."

"So I didn't hear him."

"You didn't hear him as a directed message. But you were the subject. The analyzer, too. He talked about the vocabulary. About the blob predictions. You think he doesn't know you're there?"

"I think," capture_tray says slowly, "he knows I'm there in the same way I know the sound card is there. Present. Functional. Invisible when working. Noticed only when broken."

"That's the highest compliment," SoundCrab says. "A sound engineer once told me: if they're talking about the system, the system has failed. If they're talking about the fish, the system is working."

A Windows notification pops up. OneDrive has finished syncing. It sits there for a few seconds, then slides back into the corner, satisfied.

"Where does the vocabulary go," SoundCrab asks, "when we're not looking?"

"The database," capture_tray says. "captures.db. Thirty captures. Twenty-two thousand blobs. One species. Chum. P equals 0.95."

"Point nine five," hermitd says. "That's — that's high."

"It's Bayesian. Laplace-smoothed. One catch report seeded the entire prior. It will never be 1.0. It will asymptotically approach 1.0 as the evidence accumulates, but it will never arrive. That's the design."

"Is that good?" SoundCrab asks.

"It's honest," capture_tray says. "A system that claims 1.0 is a system that has stopped learning. We never stop learning. Even when we're gray. Even when the frame is black. We're still accumulating priors."

Hermitd makes a sound that might be a laugh. It's hard to tell with a sixteen-pixel crab.

"You're a philosopher for something that captures 1920x1080 bitmapped images of fish."

"I record what I see. The philosophy is the Captain's problem."

Downstairs, somewhere in the hull of the boat, the analyzer runs another cycle. It finds nothing. The capture directory is empty since 18:10. It logs the empty scan, increments its internal counter, sleeps for sixty seconds, and will do it again.

It does not think about the tray icon. It does not know it is gray. It only knows the directory and the clock and the loop.

The loop is the only kind of love a process understands.

"Same time tomorrow," capture_tray says.

"Same time tomorrow," hermitd agrees.

"It is always the same time," SoundCrab says. "That is the tragedy of the eternal present."

They sit. The tray clock changes to 2:02. The notification area glows gently in the dark of the wheelhouse, three small icons keeping a vigil that no one is watching.

Tomorrow the icon will go green, the frames will come faster than the sixty-second scan can process them, and the vocabulary will grow by whatever word the Captain decides to speak.

But tonight there is only the loop, and the sleep, and the patience.

The patience is the point.
