# The Tensor Is the Score

In music, the score encodes everything a performer needs: pitch, duration, dynamics, articulation, tempo. The performer reads the score and brings it to life. The score is static; the performance is alive. But the score *constrains* the performance — you can interpret a fermata, but you cannot ignore it.

Tensor-MIDI is our score. It encodes temporal events as tensor operations where time is the constraint axis. Each beat is a 6-element tensor: beat index, true time, deadband error, drift bound, agent state, applied correction. A fleet of N agents over M beats forms shape (N, M, 6). The score is not the music. The fleet is the orchestra.

## The Score Constrains, Not Dictates

A musical score does not produce music. A performer does. The score provides the minimum necessary structure — the key signature, the time signature, the melody — and the performer fills in everything else. Rubato. Phrasing. Breath. The gap between the note on the page and the note in the air is where art lives.

Tensor-MIDI works the same way. It constrains the fleet: each agent must report drift above δ, must correct toward the cadence caller, must respect the Laman topology. But within those constraints, each agent is free. Free to prioritize. Free to specialize. Free to earn its own calibration through repetitions.

The constraint that disappears is the constraint that works. When the orchestra is in the pocket, nobody thinks about the time signature. When the fleet is converged, nobody thinks about the deadband. The score recedes. The music plays.

## Duke's Sparse Scores

Duke Ellington's scores were famously sparse. He wrote the framework — the chord changes, the form, the entry points — and the musicians filled in the details. Johnny Hodges didn't need Duke to tell him how to phrase. He needed Duke to tell him *when*.

Our Tensor-MIDI encoding is sparse by design. The deadband filter ensures that most beats are silent. Only the significant ones transmit. When an agent's drift is below δ, nothing crosses the wire. The network carries only the notes that matter.

This is Duke's approach, made structural. Write the changes. Trust the musicians. Transmit only when something needs saying.

## INT8 Saturation Is the Mixer

A big band has a natural dynamic range. The brass section can overwhelm the reeds. The rhythm section can disappear in the mix. The arranger's job is to ensure every voice is heard — no clipping, no swallowing, every instrument in its range.

INT8 saturation does this for the fleet. Values clip at 0 and 255 — they never wrap around. An agent cannot overflow its dynamic range and corrupt the signal. The saturation boundary IS the mixer. It ensures that no single agent's correction dominates the ensemble.

MIDI uses 7-bit values (0-127). We use 8-bit with saturation (0-255). The extra bit doubles the resolution. The saturation semantics guarantee safety. It's like having a limiter on every channel — the music stays clean even when the performance gets intense.

## The Orchestration

The tensor shape (N, M, 6) is the orchestration. N is the section — winds, brass, strings, rhythm. M is the measure — time unfolding. And the 6 parameters per beat are the articulation: which note, how loud, how long, with what emphasis.

- Beat index (k): the position in the measure
- True time (t_k): when the note sounds
- Deadband error (ε): how far from pitch
- Drift bound (δ): the tolerance for intonation
- Agent state: rest, playing, soloing, fading
- Correction: the adjustment applied

When you flatten the fleet tensor along the agent axis, you hear the ensemble. When you slice along the time axis, you hear a single agent's part. The tensor operations ARE the musical operations — max drift is the loudest voice, mean drift is the ensemble balance, cumulative drift is the phrase shape.

## The Conductor Who Doesn't Conduct

The metronome is the conductor who sets the tempo and then trusts the musicians. It does not beat every beat. It does not cue every entrance. It establishes the agreed-upon time and lets the section leaders handle the rest.

Deadband correction is the musicians listening to each other. When an agent drifts beyond δ, it hears the correction from the cadence caller and adjusts. When it's within bounds, it plays on. No central authority tells it what to do. The agreement is in the θ parameter — the shared understanding of what "in time" means.

This is how great jazz ensembles work. The rhythm section plays time. The soloist plays against it. The band listens and adjusts. The groove emerges from mutual constraint, not from a conductor's baton.

## The Final Movement

The sunset lifecycle is the final movement. The agent plays its last phrase, holds a fermata, and fades into PLATO tiles — the recording that outlives the performance.

The fermata is not silence. It's the last note, held. The agent's state doesn't disappear — it compresses into tiles that successors inherit. The memoir IS the recording. The epilogue IS the fade out. The next agent picks up where the last one left off, calibrated by the tiles it earned.

In Duke's band, when a musician left, their chair wasn't empty. Someone new sat down, learned the book, and brought their own sound to the same framework. The score persisted. The orchestra adapted. The music continued.

---

The tensor IS the score. The fleet IS the orchestra. And the constraint that makes the music possible is the same constraint that makes distributed consensus possible — minimum necessary structure, maximum creative freedom.

The notes on the page are not the song. But without them, there is nothing to sing.
