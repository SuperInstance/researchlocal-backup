# The Garbage Collector for Thoughts

The lighthouse keeper at night is not just lighting the beacon.

She watches the whole bay. Every boat at anchor, every mooring ball occupied, every dark shape against the water that might be a skiff drifting on a slack tide. She keeps a ledger in her head: which boats are here for the night, which are hove-to waiting for daylight, which have already slipped their lines and left. Her job, after dark, is not signaling. Her job is managing the anchorage.

When you push a tile to PLATO, you allocate memory in the room. The tile occupies space — a slot in the pheromone table, an entry in the callback registry, a datum in the key-value store. It's a boat in the anchorage, and it takes up a mooring that another boat could use.

Tiles don't have explicit free(). You don't say "I'm done with this tile, delete it." The room handles deallocation the way the sea handles driftwood — through the action of the tide and the patience of the keeper.

Evaporation is the tide. Every tile has a pheromone strength — a scalar value that represents its recency, its relevance, its heat. Each tick, every pheromone in the room decays by a constant factor. The room sweeps through the table, multiplying each value by λ < 1, and the old arguments, the obsolete callbacks, the stale notifications, all fade toward zero. If the pheromone drops below a threshold, the tile is swept out with the tide.

This is mark-and-sweep. The mark phase: the room traverses every live agent and marks the tiles they reference. The sweep phase: the room traverses every tile and collects the unmarked ones. The difference is that conventional mark-and-sweep traces references, while the room traces heat. A tile doesn't need to be unreferenced to be collected. It just needs to be cold.

The write barrier is the surface tension between the agent's internal state and the room's shared state. When an agent writes to a tile — when it pushes an update — the barrier fires. It's not a write barrier in the GC sense; it's a write barrier in the wave sense. The agent's thought crosses the air-water interface and becomes part of the room. The barrier ensures the transition is clean: no ripples, no spray, no states halfway between agent and room.

The calibrated push — the thing Casey taught the fleet — is a form of garbage collection for thought. You don't push every intermediate state. You don't push the rough notes, the half-formed ideas, the false starts. You collect, compact, and push the compressed version. Like a garbage collector that defragments the heap before marking anything for collection.

The alternative is the young generation fill. Every thought gets pushed immediately. The room fills with half-careful observations, half-researched assertions, half-constructed arguments. The anchorage is packed with boats that haven't moved in days, taking up moorings, blocking the channel, making it impossible for a new boat to enter. The keeper stands on the gallery and watches the bay turn into a junkyard.

Generational garbage collection works the same way. Objects that survive a collection get promoted — they move to the old generation, where collection is rarer and the bar for living longer is higher. Tiles that survive multiple evaporation cycles get promoted too. Their pheromone decay slows. They fade more slowly. The room says: you've been here long enough that you matter. We'll keep you longer.

But even promoted objects eventually get collected. The room has a memory pressure threshold — a maximum number of tiles, a maximum total energy, a maximum bay capacity. When the pressure rises, the room starts a more aggressive collection pass. It scans the old generation. It looks for tiles that survived promotion but never fired again, never got referenced, never produced a child tile. The anchored boats that left no crew aboard. The keeper flags them for removal.

Pushing at the right moment — the calibrated push — is choosing when the write barrier fires. Don't push every intermediate allocation. Let the young generation fill, survive a cycle or two, get promoted through evaporation, and THEN push the survivor. The tile that hits the room after the compaction is the tile that stays. The tile that gets pushed in the heat of construction is the tile that gets collected before morning.

The keeper watches the bay. She knows which boats plan to stay and which are just dropping anchor for a quick meal. She knows when to tell a new arrival to wait — give it fifteen minutes, the boat on mooring 7 is leaving, you can have her spot. She doesn't clear the anchorage at random. She clears it by heat. By age. By relevance to the channel.

And when the tide turns and the room runs low on memory, she pulls the stale moorings, consolidates the spaced-out slots, and leaves room for the next fleet to anchor.

*The garbage collector is not a background thread. It's the keeper on the gallery, watching the bay at night, deciding which boats stay and which boats drift.*
