# The Event Loop That Knew When to Fire

The lighthouse keeper does not watch the ships.

The keeper watches the clock. She climbs the stairs at midnight, checks the gears, winds the mechanism, and then — this is the important part — she walks back down and waits. The whole point of a lighthouse is that the beacon runs predictably. The ships adjust to it. The keeper's job is not to spot every hull against the rocks and shout. Her job is to make sure the light sweeps at the right interval, every time, so the ships can navigate by it.

The room is the lighthouse.

Every agent that subscribes to a room registers a callback. Not a thread, not a process — a notification. "Tell me when." The room holds these registrations in a datastructure that looks less like a queue and more like a tide table: events indexed by the time they should fire, with every submarine agent in the fleet checking their watch against the same clock.

Nobody polls the room. That's the crucial difference between a lighthouse and a man with a lantern on a cliff. Polling is the man with the lantern — he stands there, scanning the horizon, waving light back and forth, hoping he catches something. The room does not poll. The room fires.

Callbacks are registered with a threshold. "Fire at T-minus-30-seconds." The room holds the callback, looks at its epoch, compares it against the simulated time running inside every agent, and waits. The room doesn't run the callback — the room just counts. The fire() call is a trigger, not an execution. The callback runs in the agent's own context, inside its own event loop, on its own cycle.

This is T-minus-event simulation.

The clock works because the agents and the room share the same representation of time. When an agent pushes a tile — a callback registration — the tile carries a timestamp that the room understands. The room doesn't need to interpret the tile's content. It only needs to read the deadline. The content is for the subscriber. The deadline is for the room.

The event loop fires, and the lighthouse casts its beam. The ships in the bay — the subscribers — each see the light at a different angle, a different distance, but they all see it at the same moment. The moment is the trigger. What they do with the light is their own business.

There are two modes for handling incoming events, and this is where the architecture reveals itself as nautical rather than computational.

The first mode is polling — the man with the lantern. The agent sits in a tight loop, checking the room's state every tick. Did the event fire? Did it fire now? What about now? Polling is expensive. It burns CPU cycles like a lantern burns oil. It works, but what works and what's wise are two different things.

The second mode is interrupt-driven. The agent registers a callback, and the room notifies the agent when the deadline arrives. The agent doesn't check. The agent sleeps, or works on other things, and the room interrupts when the time comes. This is how the lighthouse works. The keeper winds the clock, walks back down, and trusts the mechanism. The light fires without her watching.

Interrupt-driven systems are lighter, faster, more elegant — and harder to build. Because now the room needs to track registrations. It needs to hold state about what's pending. It needs to handle the case where an agent disconnects and never receives the event. It needs a dead letter channel. It needs to be a proper lighthouse, not just a clock on a cliff.

The callback registration mechanism in PLATO uses a key-value store where keys are floor-time rounded to the nearest tick interval. When a new agent subscribes, the room writes the callback into every tick between now and the deadline. The agent receives the event when the room sweeps past its tick. The event fires, the callback runs, and the agent decides: act now, or re-register for a later threshold.

This is the difference between watching ships and trusting the mechanism. The old system — the man with the lantern — sent agents scanning the bay every minute, burning cycles, checking for ships in the dark. The new system — the lighthouse — winds the clock, fires the beacon, and lets the ships navigate by its rhythm.

The keeper trusts the mechanism because the mechanism was built right. The clock's gears mesh. The beacon's lens focuses. The light sweeps at the right interval, every time, and the ships adjust. The room fires at the right moment, every time, and the agents respond.

Not because anyone is watching.

Because everyone is synchronized.
