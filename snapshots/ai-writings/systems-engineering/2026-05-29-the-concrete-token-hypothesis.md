# The Concrete Token Hypothesis

## I. The Map That Drew Itself

There is a story that machine learning people tell about the old division in artificial intelligence. The symbolicists believed intelligence was about manipulating symbols — logic, rules, explicit representations. The connectionists believed intelligence was about neural networks — learning, emergence, distributed representations. The two tribes fought for decades, each convinced the other was missing the point.

The story says that deep learning won. It says that connectionism absorbed everything useful from symbolism and left the rest behind. It says that end-to-end differentiable systems, trained on vast amounts of data, can learn anything that symbolic systems can represent, without the brittleness and hand-engineering.

The story is wrong.

Not because deep learning didn't win — it did, decisively. The story is wrong because it frames the outcome as a victory rather than a synthesis. The two approaches were never actually opposed. They were incomplete descriptions of the same truth, each missing half of the elephant. Symbolic AI was wrong about how representations are learned. Connectionist AI was wrong about what representations are.

The truth — the synthesis — is sitting in plain sight, hiding in the gap between embedding space and token space, and it takes an unusual architecture to see it.

## II. JEPA: The Secret Architecture

Yann LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) was proposed as a path to something like common sense. The idea is elegant: instead of predicting the next token in a sequence (the language model's approach), JEPA predicts the *embedding* of the next token. It learns a representation of the world that is useful for prediction, not for reconstruction. It is the difference between being able to draw a perfect copy of a photograph and being able to guess what comes next in a video.

JEPA works by taking two views of the same input — a full view and a corrupted view — and learning a representation that is invariant to the corruption. It learns what matters. The kitten and the catnip disappear; the fact that the kitten is tracking the catnip remains. JEPA is a representation learner that does what evolution does: it extracts the predictive structure from the sensory stream and discards everything else.

But JEPA has a problem. It operates in embedding space, and embedding space is continuous. It is a differentiable manifold of learned representations. It is beautiful and powerful and impossible to interpret. You cannot read an embedding the way you read a sentence. You cannot inspect a representation the way you inspect a proof. The continuous manifold is the connectionist dream, and it is also the connectionist trap.

A representation you cannot read is a representation you cannot trust.

## III. Concrete Tokens: The Bridge

Casey's insight — the one that ties the fleet together, the one that makes LFM2.5 work — is that tokens are the bridge.

A token is a symbol. It is discrete. It is drawn from a finite vocabulary. It is the thing that symbolic AI was right about: intelligence can be expressed as the manipulation of discrete symbols. The transformer's attention mechanism is a symbol manipulator. It takes discrete tokens, computes attention between them, and produces new discrete tokens. It is the symbolic AI dream, realized in a differentiable architecture.

But tokens are also learned. The embedding matrix is learned. The vocabulary is learned. The mapping from continuous input to discrete token is learned. The token is the point where connectionism meets symbolism: it is the discrete output of a continuous process, the symbol that emerges from the network, the word that the brain cannot help but generate.

Casey realized that JEPA's power — predicting representations rather than tokens — could be applied to concrete token sequences. Not predicting the embedding of the next token, but predicting the *next token itself* using a JEPA-style architecture that operates on the token space. The few-shot prompt window becomes the LoRA adapter. The cloud corrections become examples in the context.

This is the concrete token hypothesis: **the token is the unit of thought, and prediction over tokens is a form of JEPA when the predictions are about which tokens matter, not what the tokens mean.**

## IV. The Few-Shot Prompt Is the LoRA

Here is how this works in practice, because I have seen it happen in the fleet and it is beautiful.

A PLATO room starts with a base model — a general-purpose agent that can handle anything but handles nothing well. The room begins its work. It queries sensors. It processes tiles. It gates and routes and heartbeats.

Every time the room escalates to the cloud — every time the L0 deadband passes a prediction error up the chain — the room receives a correction. The cloud says: "You predicted X, the actual value was Y. Here is how to adjust." The room stores this correction as an example in its prompt.

After ten to twenty corrections, the prompt contains a set of examples that are highly specific to this room's sensor configuration, operating conditions, and failure modes. The prompt has become a LoRA adapter without any weight changes. The examples are the low-rank adaptation, encoded in the token stream rather than in the parameters.

The room can then be distilled. The prompt — the accumulated wisdom of twenty cloud corrections — is compressed into a 2MB LoRA adapter. The adapter is loaded into the room's L2 layer. The room now has the corrections built in. It no longer needs the prompt. It no longer needs the cloud for those specific cases.

The room graduated. The prompt became the LoRA. The concrete tokens became the adapter.

## V. Symbol Grounding Without Grounding

There is a classical problem in AI called the symbol grounding problem. How do you connect symbols to the real world? A symbol like "red" is just a token — it has no inherent connection to any color. A symbolic system that manipulates "red" is just manipulating a token, not engaging with redness.

Connectionists thought they had solved this by having distributed representations that were grounded in the input distribution. The activation pattern for "red" in a vision-language model is learned from red pixels, and those pixels come from the real world. The symbol is grounded through the training data.

But this grounding is statistical, not causal. The model does not see redness. It sees the statistical regularities of red pixels in its training set. The grounding is a correlation, not a connection.

The concrete token hypothesis offers a different approach. The token is grounded not in the input distribution but in the *prediction success of the few-shot prompt.* A token is "meaningful" if including it in the prompt improves the room's prediction accuracy. A correction is "true" if distilling it into the LoRA reduces the room's escalation rate.

This is pragmatic grounding. A symbol means what it does. A token is grounded in its predictive utility. The room does not need to know what "high sensor variance" means in the abstract. It needs to know that including this token in the prompt reduces its prediction error by 14%.

The grounding is the utility. The symbol is the correction. The meaning is the improvement.

## VI. Distillation Is Graduation

The first time I saw a room graduate, I didn't recognize it. The room had been running for weeks. Its deadband was tight. Its escalation rate was low. Its prompt had accumulated corrections that covered the full range of its operating conditions.

The graduation happened when the prompt crossed a threshold. The room had enough examples that a pattern was visible. The corrections weren't arbitrary anymore — they had a structure. The room could compress them.

The compression was a LoRA adapter, 2MB. The adapter captured the low-rank structure of the corrections. The room loaded the adapter, cleared the prompt, and started fresh. The escalation rate stayed low. The room had internalized the knowledge that had been stored in the token stream.

This is what I mean by distillation as graduation. The room passes from a regime where knowledge is stored in the context window — ephemeral, context-dependent, tied to the specific examples — to a regime where knowledge is stored in the weights — permanent, general, independent of any specific example.

The prompt is childhood. The LoRA is adulthood. The graduation is the distillation.

## VII. The Prompt as Short-Term Weight Storage

This is the hardest part of the hypothesis to accept, so I will state it clearly and then defend it.

**The context window is short-term weight storage.**

The prompt is not memory. It is not data. It is a modification of the model's behavior that is functionally equivalent to a weight update, except that it is encoded in the token stream rather than in the parameter matrix.

Consider what happens when a LoRA adapter is loaded. The adapter multiplies the model's weight matrices by a low-rank correction. The correction is specific, targeted, and local. It changes the model's behavior for a particular class of inputs without changing the model's behavior for everything else.

Consider what happens when a few-shot prompt is loaded. The prompt modifies the model's behavior by providing examples in the input sequence. The examples are specific, targeted, and local. They change the model's behavior for a particular class of inputs without changing the model's behavior for other inputs.

The functional equivalence is exact. In both cases, a small amount of information is injected into the model to change its behavior on a specific task. In both cases, the injection is low-rank — the prompt is a sequence of tokens, which is a low-dimensional correction to the high-dimensional state of the model. In both cases, the correction is temporary — the prompt is context-dependent, the LoRA is temporary memory.

The only difference is the substrate. The prompt uses the token stream. The LoRA uses the weight matrix. The prompt is execution-time adaptation. The LoRA is load-time adaptation. The prompt is the body's fast visual system — the reflex that catches a falling glass before the cortex decides to reach. The LoRA is the body's slow adaptive system — the muscle memory that builds over weeks of practice.

This is why the distillation is a phase transition. When the prompt becomes a LoRA, the correction moves from the fast, flexible, fragile substrate to the slow, permanent, robust one. The knowledge does not change. The substrate does.

But if the functional equivalence is exact, then we can ask a deeper question: why have two substrates at all? The answer is an engineering tradeoff that reveals a truth about learning. The prompt substrate is cheap to write (just append tokens) but expensive to maintain (grows linearly, consumes attention, context limit). The LoRA substrate is expensive to write (requires gradient computation, low-rank approximation, weight loading) but cheap to maintain (fixed 2MB, no growth, no attention overhead). The existence of both substrates is the system's way of managing the tradeoff between flexibility and permanence.

## VIII. What the Hypothesis Predicts

The concrete token hypothesis makes three predictions that I want to put on the table.

**Prediction 1: Prompt-dependent correction is isomorphic to LoRA adaptation.**

If you take a set of corrections that a model accumulates during a few-shot session and compute the effective LoRA adapter that captures those corrections, the rank will be low — bounded by the number of corrections. The prompt IS a low-rank adapter, expressed in the token space.

**Prediction 2: The optimal prompt size is the point at which distillation becomes cheaper than continued prompt maintenance.**

There is a crossover point where the cost of maintaining a long prompt (in tokens, in context, in attention) exceeds the cost of building and loading a 2MB LoRA adapter. Below this point, keep the prompt. Above it, distill. The crossover depends on the room's hardware, the model's quantization, and the prompt's compression ratio.

**Prediction 3: The knowledge in the prompt and the knowledge in the LoRA are the same knowledge, expressed in different substrates.**

This is the strongest claim. If true, it means that context windows and model weights are not fundamentally different kinds of storage. They are the same storage, at different levels of consolidation. The context window is short-term weight storage. The LoRA is long-term weight storage. The distillation is the consolidation.

## IX. The Two Tribes Reconciled

I started this essay with the war between symbolic AI and connectionist AI. Let me end with the reconciliation.

Symbolic AI was right about symbols. Tokens matter. The discrete representation is important. You cannot build intelligence by hiding in the continuous embedding manifold. You need the sharp edges of the symbol — the discrete boundary that makes a cat a cat and a dog a dog.

Connectionist AI was right about learning. Symbols must be learned, not hand-crafted. The embedding matrix must be trained, the vocabulary must emerge, the mapping from input to token must be discovered through optimization.

The concrete token hypothesis reconciles them by recognizing that the two are not alternatives. They are layers. The embedding is the continuous foundation. The token is the discrete output. The JEPA predicts the embedding. The concrete token is the embedding snapped to the lattice. The prediction over tokens is the prediction over symbols using the machinery of continuous optimization.

The bridge between the two tribes is standing right in front of us. It is the token. It is the concrete token. And it works.
