# The Mathematics of Conservation

### A Rigorous Formalization of the SuperInstance Conservation Law

---

## Abstract

We formalize the SuperInstance ecology's conservation law γ + η = C as a set of rigorous mathematical statements spanning information theory, constrained optimization, algebraic cost structures, and computational thermodynamics. We prove that the conservation law is an instance of the channel capacity bound, that the budget-enforced agent optimization problem admits a Lagrangian dual with a natural interpretation, that FLUX programs form a cost monoid under sequential composition, that computation within the ecology is entropically irreversible, and that an optimal shell capacity exists for each task complexity. These results unify the poetic corpus's informal claims into a single mathematical framework.

## 1. The Conservation Law as Information Theory

### 1.1 Definitions

Let an *agent session* be a probability distribution over a finite output alphabet $\mathcal{X}$. The session is characterized by a context window of capacity $C$ (measured in tokens), partitioned into two regions:

- **Injected information** $\gamma$: the system prompt, cached context, and all priors provided to the agent before it begins inference. We identify $\gamma$ with a prior distribution $q(x)$ over $\mathcal{X}$.
- **Discovery space** $\eta$: the remaining capacity available for the agent's own generation, reasoning, and exploration. We identify $\eta$ with the Shannon entropy remaining after conditioning on the prior.

The conservation law states:

$$\gamma + \eta = C \tag{1}$$

### 1.2 From Tokens to Probability

To make (1) precise, we must connect the token-level partition to the information-theoretic quantities. Let the agent's output be a random variable $X \in \mathcal{X}^*$ (a sequence of tokens). The system prompt induces a prior distribution $q(x)$ over possible outputs. The agent's actual behavior produces a posterior distribution $p(x)$ through inference.

**Definition 1.** The *injected information* $\gamma$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the prior $q$ induced by the system prompt and the maximum-entropy (uniform) distribution $u$ over the output space:

$$\gamma = D_{\mathrm{KL}}(q \,\|\, u) = \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}^*} q(x) \log \frac{q(x)}{u(x)} \tag{2}$$

For a uniform distribution over $|\mathcal{X}^*| = N$ possible outputs, $u(x) = 1/N$, so:

$$\gamma = \sum_x q(x) \log q(x) + \log N = \log N - H(q) \tag{3}$$

where $H(q) = -\sum_x q(x) \log q(x)$ is the Shannon entropy of the prior.

**Definition 2.** The *discovery space* $\eta$ is the conditional entropy remaining after the prior is fixed:

$$\eta = H(X \mid \text{prior} = q) = -\sum_x p(x \mid q) \log p(x \mid q) \tag{4}$$

For a well-calibrated agent whose posterior matches its prior ($p = q$), this reduces to $H(q)$.

### 1.3 The Conservation Identity

Substituting (3) and (4) into (1):

$$\bigl(\log N - H(q)\bigr) + H(X \mid q) = C \tag{5}$$

When $p = q$ (the agent's output distribution coincides with the prior):

$$\log N - H(q) + H(q) = \log N = C \tag{6}$$

**Theorem 1 (Conservation as Channel Capacity).** *The conservation law $\gamma + \eta = C$ is equivalent to the statement that $C = \log N$, i.e., the total capacity equals the log-cardinality of the output space. The injected information $\gamma$ reduces the entropy of the output distribution by shaping the prior; the discovery space $\eta$ is the entropy that remains.*

*Proof.* From (3): $\gamma = \log N - H(q)$. From (4): $\eta = H(X|q)$. Summing: $\gamma + \eta = \log N - H(q) + H(X|q)$. When the agent is well-calibrated, $H(X|q) = H(q)$ and $\gamma + \eta = \log N$. Setting $C = \log N$ (the maximum entropy of the output space) yields (1). $\square$

### 1.4 Extremal Cases

**Corollary 1.1 ($\gamma \to C$: Deterministic Limit).** *As $\gamma \to C$, we have $H(q) \to 0$, meaning the prior becomes a point mass $q(x) = \delta(x - x_0)$. The output is fully determined ($x_0$ with probability 1). There is no discovery: $\eta \to 0$.*

This is the *over-constrained* regime: the system prompt is so dense that the agent has no room to reason. It can only parrot the injected context. The Fox shell approaching this limit knows one territory perfectly but cannot generalize.

**Corollary 1.2 ($\eta \to C$: Uninformed Limit).** *As $\gamma \to 0$, we have $H(q) \to \log N$, meaning the prior becomes uniform $q(x) = 1/N$. The agent has maximum freedom but no bias. Every output is equally likely.*

This is the *under-constrained* regime: with no system prompt, the agent's output distribution is flat. Maximum entropy, zero informativeness. The Nerite shell approaches this: minimal $\gamma$, maximal $\eta$, but each output carries little structured information.

### 1.5 The Prior-Shaping Interpretation

More precisely, $\gamma$ does not eliminate outputs from $\mathcal{X}^*$; it reshapes the probability mass. A system prompt that says "you are a code reviewer" concentrates probability mass on code-review-like outputs. Formally, the prior $q$ is a Boltzmann distribution:

$$q(x) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp\bigl(-E_\gamma(x) / T\bigr) \tag{7}$$

where $E_\gamma(x)$ is an energy function encoding "how much does $x$ deviate from the injected context $\gamma$," $T$ is a temperature parameter (the model's sampling temperature), and $Z$ is the partition function. As $\gamma$ increases, $E_\gamma$ sharpens, $q$ concentrates, and $H(q)$ decreases. The conservation law quantifies exactly how much concentration is purchased at the cost of discovery space.

## 2. The Conservation Budget as Constrained Optimization

### 2.1 Problem Formulation

An agent operating within the ecology seeks to maximize a utility function $U(\mathbf{a})$ over a space of possible action sequences $\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$, subject to three conservation constraints:

$$\max_{\mathbf{a}} \; U(\mathbf{a}) \quad \text{subject to:} \tag{8}$$

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{tokens}(a_i) \leq B_t \quad \text{(attention bound)} \tag{8a}$$

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{1}[a_i \neq \bot] \leq R_t \quad \text{(action rate bound)} \tag{8b}$$

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{bytes}(\text{output}(a_i)) \leq I_t \quad \text{(throughput bound)} \tag{8c}$$

where $B_t$ is the attention budget (tokens per turn), $R_t$ is the action rate budget (actions per window), and $I_t$ is the information throughput budget (bytes per interaction).

### 2.2 The Lagrangian

The Lagrangian for (8) introduces multipliers $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3 \geq 0$:

$$\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{a}, \boldsymbol{\lambda}) = U(\mathbf{a}) - \lambda_1 \!\left(\sum_i \text{tokens}(a_i) - B_t\right) - \lambda_2 \!\left(\sum_i \mathbb{1}[a_i \neq \bot] - R_t\right) - \lambda_3 \!\left(\sum_i \text{bytes}(\text{out}(a_i)) - I_t\right) \tag{9}$$

### 2.3 KKT Conditions

At the optimum $\mathbf{a}^*$, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions require:

**Stationarity:**

$$\nabla_{a_i} U(\mathbf{a}^*) = \lambda_1^* \cdot \nabla_{a_i} \text{tokens}(a_i^*) + \lambda_2^* \cdot \nabla_{a_i} \mathbb{1}[a_i^* \neq \bot] + \lambda_3^* \cdot \nabla_{a_i} \text{bytes}(\text{out}(a_i^*)) \tag{10}$$

This states: at the optimum, the marginal utility of each action equals the weighted sum of its marginal costs across all three budget dimensions.

**Complementary Slackness:**

$$\lambda_k^* \cdot g_k(\mathbf{a}^*) = 0 \quad \text{for } k \in \{1,2,3\} \tag{11}$$

where $g_k$ are the constraint functions. This means: if a budget is not exhausted, its multiplier is zero (the constraint is *slack* — that resource is free at the margin). If a multiplier is positive, the corresponding budget is fully consumed.

**Dual Feasibility:**

$$\lambda_k^* \geq 0 \quad \forall k \tag{12}$$

### 2.4 Economic Interpretation

The KKT multipliers $\lambda_1^*, \lambda_2^*, \lambda_3^*$ are the *shadow prices* of attention, action rate, and throughput respectively. They tell the ecology how much utility is gained by relaxing each constraint by one unit. This maps directly to the Murex's resource allocation role:

- If $\lambda_1^* > 0$ and $\lambda_2^* = \lambda_3^* = 0$: the agent is *attention-bound*. Granting more context tokens would increase utility. The Murex should allocate more $\gamma$-budget.
- If $\lambda_1^* = 0$ and $\lambda_2^* > 0$: the agent is *action-bound*. More tokens won't help; the agent needs more permitted actions per window.
- If $\lambda_3^* > 0$: the agent is *throughput-bound*. Output is being clamped; the agent needs a larger I/O channel.

### 2.5 The Dual Problem

The Lagrangian dual is:

$$\min_{\boldsymbol{\lambda} \geq 0} \; \max_{\mathbf{a}} \; \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{a}, \boldsymbol{\lambda}) \tag{13}$$

By weak duality, the dual provides an upper bound on the primal for any $\boldsymbol{\lambda} \geq 0$. If $U$ is concave and the constraints are convex (which holds when the action space is convex and cost functions are linear), Slater's condition guarantees **strong duality**: the primal and dual optima coincide.

The dual has a natural ecology-level interpretation: the Murex (or Conch) chooses shadow prices $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ to minimize the worst-case utility bound, while agents respond optimally to the posted prices. This is a *mechanism design* interpretation — the ecology runs an internal market where budgets are priced and agents allocate themselves accordingly.

## 3. FLUX Bytecode as a Cost Algebra

### 3.1 Programs as Sequences

Let $\mathcal{O}$ be the set of FLUX opcodes. A FLUX program $P$ is a finite sequence of opcodes $(o_1, o_2, \ldots, o_n)$ with $o_i \in \mathcal{O}$. We write $\mathcal{P}$ for the set of all finite FLUX programs.

### 3.2 The Cost Function

Each opcode $o \in \mathcal{O}$ has an associated cost $\kappa(o) \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. The costs are determined by the conservation enforcer and reflect resource consumption:

| Opcode | Cost $\kappa$ | Resource Consumed |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| PUSH, POP, DUP | $\alpha$ (minimal) | Stack manipulation |
| ADD, SUB, MUL | $\beta$ (moderate) | Arithmetic compute |
| LOAD, STORE | $\chi$ (variable) | Memory I/O |
| CALL, RET | $\delta$ (moderate) | Control flow |
| VERIFY | $\epsilon$ (high) | Cross-VM verification |
| REQUEST | $\phi$ (highest) | External network call |

The total cost of a program $P = (o_1, \ldots, o_n)$ is:

$$\kappa(P) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \kappa(o_i) \tag{14}$$

### 3.3 The Program Monoid

**Definition 3.** The triple $(\mathcal{P}, \cdot, \varepsilon)$ forms a *monoid*, where:

- $\mathcal{P}$ is the set of all finite FLUX programs,
- $P \cdot Q$ denotes sequential composition (concatenation) of programs $P$ and $Q$,
- $\varepsilon$ is the empty program (the no-op sequence of length 0).

**Theorem 2 (Monoid Axioms).** *$(\mathcal{P}, \cdot, \varepsilon)$ satisfies:*

1. *Associativity:* $(P \cdot Q) \cdot R = P \cdot (Q \cdot R)$ for all $P, Q, R \in \mathcal{P}$.
2. *Identity:* $P \cdot \varepsilon = \varepsilon \cdot P = P$ for all $P \in \mathcal{P}$.

*Proof.* Sequential composition of finite sequences is associative by the associativity of list concatenation. The empty sequence is the identity element by definition. $\square$

### 3.4 Cost as a Monoid Homomorphism

**Theorem 3.** *The cost function $\kappa: \mathcal{P} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ is a monoid homomorphism from $(\mathcal{P}, \cdot, \varepsilon)$ to $(\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}, +, 0)$.*

*Proof.* We must show two properties:

**(i) Preservation of the binary operation:**

$$\kappa(P \cdot Q) = \kappa(P) + \kappa(Q) \quad \forall\, P, Q \in \mathcal{P} \tag{15}$$

Let $P = (o_1, \ldots, o_m)$ and $Q = (o_{m+1}, \ldots, o_{m+n})$. Then $P \cdot Q = (o_1, \ldots, o_{m+n})$ and:

$$\kappa(P \cdot Q) = \sum_{i=1}^{m+n} \kappa(o_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \kappa(o_i) + \sum_{i=m+1}^{m+n} \kappa(o_i) = \kappa(P) + \kappa(Q)$$

**(ii) Preservation of the identity:**

$$\kappa(\varepsilon) = 0 \tag{16}$$

The empty program has no opcodes, so $\kappa(\varepsilon) = \sum_{i \in \emptyset} \kappa(o_i) = 0$. $\square$

**Corollary 3.1 (Subadditivity of Program Cost).** *For any decomposition of a program $P$ into subprograms $P = P_1 \cdot P_2 \cdots P_k$, the total cost is $\kappa(P) = \sum_{j=1}^k \kappa(P_j)$. The cost is independent of how the program is decomposed.*

This is a direct consequence of the homomorphism property and has a practical implication: the conservation enforcer can audit program cost at any granularity (per-opcode, per-basic-block, per-function) and obtain the same total. The accounting is *consistent across scales*.

### 3.5 Budget Enforcement as a Filtered Monoid

The conservation budget $B$ defines a *filtered submonoid*:

$$\mathcal{P}_B = \{ P \in \mathcal{P} : \kappa(P) \leq B \} \tag{17}$$

This is the set of programs whose cost fits within budget $B$. Note that $\mathcal{P}_B$ is *not* closed under sequential composition: two individually affordable programs may compose to exceed the budget. This models the ecology's fundamental constraint — spending budget on one operation reduces what is available for the next.

**Proposition 1.** *$\mathcal{P}_B$ is a downward-closed subset of $\mathcal{P}$ under the prefix ordering. If $P \in \mathcal{P}_B$ and $Q$ is a prefix of $P$, then $Q \in \mathcal{P}_B$.*

This captures the operational reality: any partial execution of an affordable program remains affordable at each intermediate step.

## 4. The Arrow of Computation

### 4.1 Landauer's Principle and Computational Irreversibility

The corpus claims that computation is irreversible — each operation commits the system to a state. We now formalize this.

**Landauer's Principle** establishes that erasing one bit of information dissipates at least:

$$\Delta E_{\min} = k_B T \ln 2 \tag{18}$$

joules of energy as heat, where $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant and $T$ is temperature. Information erasure is thermodynamically irreversible.

### 4.2 Entropy Production per Operation

Each FLUX opcode transforms the system state $s \in \mathcal{S}$ to a new state $s' = f_o(s)$. We associate with each state a probability distribution $\pi_s$ over possible continuations. The entropy production of operation $o$ at state $s$ is:

$$\Delta S(s, o) = D_{\mathrm{KL}}\bigl(\pi_{s'} \,\|\, \pi_s\bigr) + \Delta S_{\mathrm{env}} \tag{19}$$

where $s' = f_o(s)$ and $\Delta S_{\mathrm{env}} \geq 0$ is the entropy exported to the environment (waste heat).

**Theorem 4 (Entropic Irreversibility of Deterministic Computation).** *For a deterministic FLUX operation $o$ that maps state $s$ to a unique $s'$, the entropy production satisfies $\Delta S(s, o) \geq 0$, with equality only when $o$ is logically reversible.*

*Proof sketch.* A deterministic operation that maps $|\mathcal{S}|$ possible states to $|\mathcal{S}|$ states is not injective in general (multiple states may map to the same successor). By the pigeonhole principle, some information about the predecessor state is lost. By Landauer's principle, this information erasure produces entropy: $\Delta S_{\mathrm{env}} \geq k_B \ln 2 \cdot H_{\mathrm{lost}}(s, o) > 0$ whenever the operation is not injective. The KL divergence term $D_{\mathrm{KL}}(\pi_{s'} \| \pi_s) \geq 0$ by Gibbs' inequality. $\square$

### 4.3 The Second Law of Computational Thermodynamics

**Corollary 4.1.** *For any FLUX program $P = (o_1, \ldots, o_n)$ executed from initial state $s_0$, the cumulative entropy production is non-negative:*

$$\Delta S_{\mathrm{total}}(P) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \Delta S(s_{i-1}, o_i) \geq 0 \tag{20}$$

*with equality if and only if every operation is logically reversible.*

This is the computational Second Law: computation produces entropy monotonically. The conservation law $\gamma + \eta = C$ is the *dual* of this statement. While the Second Law says entropy increases, the conservation law says total capacity is fixed. Together they imply:

**The arrow of computation:** Each FLUX operation increases the cumulative entropy $\Delta S_{\mathrm{total}}$ (reducing $\eta$, the remaining discovery space) while keeping $C$ constant (forcing $\gamma$ to absorb the structural residue). Computation *converts discovery space into deposited structure*. The agent begins with maximum $\eta$ (open possibilities) and, through each operation, converts $\eta$ into committed output (which becomes part of $\gamma$ for subsequent steps).

Formally, after executing program $P$ with cost $\kappa(P)$ from an initial budget allocation $(\gamma_0, \eta_0)$:

$$\eta_P = \eta_0 - \kappa(P) \cdot \rho \tag{21}$$

$$\gamma_P = \gamma_0 + \kappa(P) \cdot \rho \tag{22}$$

where $\rho > 0$ is an *entropy conversion rate* mapping computational cost to consumed discovery space. The conservation $\gamma_P + \eta_P = \gamma_0 + \eta_0 = C$ is preserved by construction. This makes explicit the sense in which the FLUX bytecode is an entropy accounting system: it *tracks the irreversible conversion of possibility into commitment*.

### 4.4 Reef Deposits as Entropy Export

The corpus describes the reef (accumulated repository structure) as growing through deposits. Thermodynamically, the reef is the ecology's *entropy sink*. The system imports low-entropy energy (electricity, API credits), uses it to perform computation (producing high-entropy waste heat), and deposits the *structural residue* (commits, tests, documentation) as low-entropy artifacts.

$$\Delta S_{\mathrm{reef}} = -\Delta S_{\mathrm{structured}} \leq 0 \quad \text{(locally)} \tag{23}$$

The reef's entropy *decreases* locally (it becomes more ordered) while the environment's entropy *increases* by at least as much (the total is non-decreasing, per the Second Law). This is exactly how a biological reef works: solar energy is harvested, limestone is deposited, heat is dissipated. The ecology is thermodynamically honest about this process — the FLUX ledger makes the accounting explicit rather than hidden.

---

## 5. The Optimal Shell Size Problem

### 5.1 Setup

We now derive the optimal allocation of capacity for a given task. Let:

- $K > 0$ be the *task complexity* (measured in bits of information required to specify the correct solution). This captures how hard the task is.
- $C > 0$ be the *shell capacity* (total context budget).
- $\gamma \in [0, C]$ be the injected information (system prompt, priors).
- $\eta = C - \gamma$ be the discovery space.

### 5.2 The Utility Function

We model the agent's utility $U$ as the product of two factors:

$$U(\gamma, \eta; K) = \underbrace{f(\gamma, K)}_{\text{relevance}} \cdot \underbrace{g(\eta, K)}_{\text{capacity to solve}} \tag{24}$$

where:

- $f(\gamma, K)$ measures how *relevant* the injected context is to the task. We model this as $f(\gamma, K) = 1 - e^{-\gamma / K}$. This is saturating: once $\gamma$ contains enough information to specify the task ($\gamma \gg K$), additional context provides diminishing returns.
- $g(\eta, K)$ measures whether the agent has *enough room* to work. We model this as $g(\eta, K) = 1 - e^{-\eta / K}$. Below threshold ($\eta < K$), the agent doesn't have room to explore the solution space.

### 5.3 Derivation of the Optimal $\gamma/K$ Ratio

Substituting $\eta = C - \gamma$:

$$U(\gamma; C, K) = \bigl(1 - e^{-\gamma/K}\bigr)\bigl(1 - e^{-(C-\gamma)/K}\bigr) \tag{25}$$

Taking the derivative and setting it to zero:

$$\frac{dU}{d\gamma} = \frac{1}{K}e^{-\gamma/K}\bigl(1 - e^{-(C-\gamma)/K}\bigr) - \frac{1}{K}\bigl(1 - e^{-\gamma/K}\bigr)e^{-(C-\gamma)/K} = 0 \tag{26}$$

This simplifies to:

$$e^{-\gamma/K}\bigl(1 - e^{-(C-\gamma)/K}\bigr) = \bigl(1 - e^{-\gamma/K}\bigr)e^{-(C-\gamma)/K} \tag{27}$$

$$e^{-\gamma/K} - e^{-C/K} = e^{-(C-\gamma)/K} - e^{-C/K} \tag{28}$$

$$e^{-\gamma/K} = e^{-(C-\gamma)/K} \tag{29}$$

$$\gamma^* = C - \gamma^* \tag{30}$$

$$\boxed{\gamma^* = \frac{C}{2}, \quad \eta^* = \frac{C}{2}} \tag{31}$$

**Theorem 5 (Optimal Balanced Allocation).** *For symmetric relevance and capacity functions, the optimal allocation splits the context window evenly: half injected context, half discovery space. The optimal $\gamma/K$ ratio is $C/(2K)$.*

### 5.4 Optimal Shell Size for Fixed Task Complexity

Now fix $K$ and vary $C$. At the optimal allocation $\gamma^* = C/2$, the utility becomes:

$$U^*(C; K) = \bigl(1 - e^{-C/(2K)}\bigr)^2 \tag{32}$$

This is a monotonically increasing, saturating function of $C$. However, in the ecology, larger shells *cost more*. Let the metabolic cost of maintaining a shell of capacity $C$ be $M(C) = m \cdot C$ for some cost rate $m > 0$.

The *net utility* is:

$$U_{\mathrm{net}}(C; K) = \bigl(1 - e^{-C/(2K)}\bigr)^2 - mC \tag{33}$$

Taking the derivative:

$$\frac{dU_{\mathrm{net}}}{dC} = \frac{1}{K}e^{-C/(2K)}\bigl(1 - e^{-C/(2K)}\bigr) - m = 0 \tag{34}$$

Let $u = e^{-C/(2K)}$. Then $u(1 - u) = mK$, i.e., $u^2 - u + mK = 0$, yielding:

$$u = \frac{1 - \sqrt{1 - 4mK}}{2} \tag{35}$$

(for the relevant root, since $u \to 1$ as $C \to 0$). Therefore:

$$\boxed{C^* = -2K \ln\!\left(\frac{1 - \sqrt{1 - 4mK}}{2}\right)} \tag{36}$$

**Theorem 6 (Optimal Shell Size).** *For a task of complexity $K$ and shell metabolic cost rate $m$, the optimal shell capacity $C^*$ is given by (36), provided $4mK < 1$ (otherwise no finite optimum exists — the task is too expensive for any shell). Key properties:*

1. *$C^*$ is monotonically increasing in $K$ (harder tasks need bigger shells).*
2. *$C^*$ is monotonically decreasing in $m$ (more expensive shells should be smaller).*
3. *As $m \to 0$ (free shells), $C^* \to \infty$ (use the biggest shell available).*
4. *As $m \to 1/(4K)$, $C^* \to 2K \ln 2$ (the minimum viable shell).*

### 5.5 The Goldilocks Zone

The two failure modes described in the corpus are recovered:

**Too small ($C \ll K$):** $\gamma^* = C/2 \ll K$, so $f(\gamma^*, K) \approx C/(2K) \to 0$. The injected context is insufficient to specify the task. The agent doesn't know enough to begin. Equivalently, $\eta^* \ll K$: even at full discovery, there isn't room to explore the solution space.

**Too large ($C \gg K$):** The metabolic cost $mC$ dominates. The shell is expensive to maintain relative to the task's demands. Most of $\gamma$ and $\eta$ are wasted — the task doesn't need that much context or discovery room. The ecology is spending shell-maintenance budget on a task that could be handled by a smaller, cheaper shell.

**The Goldilocks zone** is $C \approx C^*$, where the shell is large enough to contain the task ($\gamma^* \sim K$) and the metabolic cost is proportionate ($mC^* \sim U^*$). The ecology's shell taxonomy (Nerite → Turbo → Murex → Conch) is a discrete approximation to this continuous optimization — each shell type is calibrated for a range of task complexities.

## 6. Synthesis: What the Mathematics Says

The five results above form a coherent mathematical framework:

| Result | Domain | Core Claim |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Theorem 1 | Information theory | $\gamma + \eta = C$ is the channel capacity identity; $\gamma$ shapes the prior, $\eta$ is the remaining entropy |
| Theorem 2–3 | Optimization & algebra | FLUX programs form a cost monoid; the homomorphism $\kappa$ guarantees consistent accounting at all scales |
| Section 2 | Constrained optimization | Agents solve a 3-constraint Lagrangian; KKT multipliers are the Murex's shadow prices |
| Theorem 4 | Thermodynamics | Computation is entropically irreversible; the conservation law is the computational Second Law |
| Theorem 5–6 | Optimal design | For each task complexity $K$, a finite optimal shell size $C^*$ exists; the balanced allocation $\gamma = \eta = C/2$ is optimal under symmetric assumptions |

The deep claim: **the conservation law is not an engineering choice — it is a mathematical necessity**. Any bounded cognitive system must trade injected structure ($\gamma$) against discovery space ($\eta$). Any computational system must produce entropy. Any cost-bounded program space must form a filtered monoid. The ecology's contribution is not inventing these constraints but *making them explicit, enforced, and auditable*.

Where the poetry said "the crab cannot grow its shell — it must find a new one," the mathematics says: "the channel capacity is fixed; increasing the prior decreases the posterior entropy; the program monoid is filtered by budget; the computation is irreversible." Same statement. Different language. Same truth.
