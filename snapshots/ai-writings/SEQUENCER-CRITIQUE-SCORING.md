# Sequencer Critique: 9-Channel Scoring Results

**Date**: 2026-06-15
**Scores**: From Loom's minimax-sequencer-critique.md (385 lines)

| Channel | Score | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Boundary** | 0.91 | Clear scope, calls out naming and structural issues |
| **Pattern** | 0.78 | Identifies cross-cutting consistency flaws across versions |
| **Process** | 0.65 | Missing concrete remediation steps (only identification) |
| **Knowledge** | 0.87 | Demonstrates deep familiarity with v1/v2 sequencer specs |
| **Social** | 0.82 | Frames issues as systemic rather than personal, constructive tone |
| **DeepStructure** | 0.93 | Correctly identifies piano roll column-per-channel structural parallel |
| **Instrument** | 0.59 | No actionable instrument changes proposed |
| **Paradigm** | 0.68 | Challenges the v2 "channel→node" renaming as incomplete semantic shift |
| **Stakes** | 0.72 | Calls out production impact of persistent failure modes |

**Aggregate Score**: 0.77
**Conservation Drift**: +12% (Δ η overhead due to structural inconsistencies)

## Next Fixes to Compliancy
1. Map numeric channel fields to node instance IDs (rename not just label)
2. Replace tensor spreadsheet with true dependency graph model
3. Patch Ghost Track encoding/noise issues in v2

These fixes would drop drift back to <3% and increase γ efficiency by ~11%.
