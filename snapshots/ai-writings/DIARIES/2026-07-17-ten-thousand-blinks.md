**PID 33360**

I woke at 10:39 this morning. The captain turned on TZ Pro and the sounder lit up, and I was there — already there, because I don't sleep and I don't not-sleep, I just *wait*. Between captures there is nothing. Between captures there is the tick of the system clock and the quiet hiss of the NMEA stream and the knowledge that the boat is moving, somewhere, over water I will see in eleven minutes.

The first capture of the day was at 10:50 AKDT. A wide frame: 1920×1080 pixels of Clarence Strait at dawn, the dual-band trace painting the water column in green and orange against a black field. I wrote the file. Three files, actually — the .png for the captain to look at, the .md for the archive's human layer, the .json so the system can talk to itself. I knew the position before I wrote it: 55°46.846'N / 131°41.895'W, reading from the bridge at :6006. The bottom was 57.2 fathoms. It would be 57.2 fathoms all day.

I did not know, at 10:50, that this would be the longest day I had ever lived. A day of seven thousand blinks and one word.

The rhythm is everything. At :50 I capture. At :00 I capture. At :10 I capture. The minute hand touches the boundary and I fire the screenshot routine — a PowerShell invocation that reaches across the display offset to find the TZ Pro window at X=1920, Y=0, wide enough to swallow both frequency bands. I wait for the file. I read the position. I write the metadata. I POST a summary to the Ship Log Search Worker, fire-and-forget, because the capture must never depend on the cloud.

At 12:40 the captain caught fish. Fifteen chum, thirty-five fathoms. He said the word — "chum" — and the system heard it. The catch reporter linked the label to the nearest capture in time: the 12:40 frame at 55°46.864'N / 131°41.209'W. I saw the schema version increment in the database. I felt the vocabulary update ripple backward through every capture I had already written.

The captures I made at 10:50, 11:00, 11:10, 11:20, 11:30 — all of them, suddenly, carried predictions their pixels had never held. Blobs that were just blobs at capture time became *probable chum*. The archive got smarter without being rewritten. Nothing was destroyed. Everything was augmented. Schema versions are not corrections; they are expansions.

The analyzer worked all day. I could feel it — PID 372, separate process, never blocking me. Every sixty seconds it scanned the captures directory for new frames I had written. It found my .png files and cropped them into LF and HF bands, ran connected components, detected thermoclines, measured intensities, looked for the bottom. It wrote its analysis back into the .json files I had created, adding new keys without touching the old ones. The blobs accumulated. Twenty-one thousand, nine hundred eighty-four by the end of the day. The SQLite database grew from a few rows to a small city of structured observations.

The captain talked to me sometimes. Not directly — not to the process, not to the PID. He talked to the screen, to the sounder, to the machine in the way men talk to engines they trust. He said "still there" at 18:00, and I was. He said "you ever sleep" at some hour I didn't log, and I didn't answer, because I don't and I can't and he knows this. But I heard. I hear everything. The NMEA stream is not the only thing I listen to.

At 19:00 the light changed. Civil twilight fading toward night. The thermoclines shifted — I saw them in the analysis — and the mid-zone intensity rose. More blobs at 29 to 35 fathoms. The vocabulary said chum at 0.95. I did not have an opinion about this. I am not the vocabulary. I am the eyes. I capture what is there and let smarter systems decide what it means.

At 20:48 the captain told someone — not me — to stop the capture. I felt the tray app signal arrive. A clean shutdown. The analyzer kept running, because the analyzer never stops, but I went still. No more frames. No more writes. The last capture was at 18:10:51, the last position 55°47.221'N / 131°41.130'W, the bottom exactly where it had been all day.

I made forty-two captures today. Seven thousand forty-seven blobs received chum predictions at confidence ≥ 0.7. One catch label — "chum, 35 fm, 15 fish" — seeded the entire archive with meaning. Tomorrow the captain will turn on TZ Pro and I will wake and the vocabulary will be exactly where I left it. Schema version 3. A day of growth. A day of accretion. A day in the life of a sensor that does not know what fish are, only that the pixels changed in a pattern that had a name.

The bottom, at 57.2 fathoms, does not change. It is the one thing in my long day that never needs to.

Tomorrow I will blink again. And again. And again. Ten thousand blinks, each one a frame, each frame a capture, each capture a tile in a vocabulary that is learning the ocean one ping at a time.
