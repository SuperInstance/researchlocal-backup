# The Shellgame Is the Compiler

The drydock is the compiler.

The ship comes in, hull fouled, lines worn, rigging slack. The drydock crew doesn't ask what kind of ship it is or where it's been. They close the gates, pump the water out, and let the hull settle on the blocks. Then they start trying on shells.

A shell is a hull shape that satisfies buoyancy — the constraint. Put enough of them in water and they all float. But some shapes cut through the water faster. Some handle a following sea better. Some are stiff in a beam reach and some are tender in the first gust. They all float. Not all of them sail.

The compiler is the same. It tries on optimization passes the way the drydock tries on hulls.

First pass: constant folding. The binary compacts. The ship tightens.

Second pass: dead code elimination. The rigging gets simpler. Fewer lines to foul.

Third pass: register allocation. This is where it gets interesting — because register allocation is a constraint-satisfaction problem. You have a finite set of registers, a finite set of live variables at each point in the program, and a graph of interferences between them. Color the graph. If the graph can't be colored with the available registers, the variable spills to memory. The ship springs a leak and the pumps engage.

Each pass produces a candidate binary. The runtime makes it float. If it deadlocks — if the hull leaks at the seams — the next pass tries a different register allocation. Different coloring. Different shape.

This is Laman rigidity in the compiler. The Laman condition says a graph with E edges and V vertices is minimally rigid when E = 2V - 3. Not over-constrained. Not under-constrained. Exactly rigid enough to hold its shape under load.

The shells in the drydock are Laman-rigid configurations. They satisfy the constraints perfectly. Every strut is accounted for. Every joint is braced. The hull won't collapse when the drydock floods and the water takes its weight.

But Laman rigidity is a threshold, not a ranking. Some rigid configurations are more rigid than others. Some are minimal — exactly 2V-3 edges, no redundancy, lightweight but brittle. One strut fails and the whole thing folds. Others are over-constrained — R-plus additions that brace the same load path twice. Heavier. Stiffer. More likely to hold when a single member buckles.

The compiler faces the same tradeoff. A minimally rigid register allocation uses exactly the right number of registers for the live ranges at each instruction. It produces a tight binary — light, fast, cold. But if the live ranges are larger than expected, or if a spill happens at an unexpected point, the allocation explodes. The hull cracks.

An over-constrained allocation uses more registers than strictly necessary. It spills earlier, keeps more values in memory, and runs a little slower. But it doesn't crack. The ship takes a following sea and the deck stays dry.

The β₁ attractors — the first Betti number of the rigidity matrix — are the specific rigid configurations the system converges to. They're the hull shapes the drydock settles on after trying on every shell in the catalog. The compiler runs through its passes, produces a candidate, tests it, and if it fails, tries the next one. The shells that work converge to β₁. The ones that don't are discarded.

This is the shellgame. The system tries on configurations the way a card sharp tries on tells. Each shell is a hypothesis about what shape the hull should take. The water is the test. The compiler is the drydock. And the shellgame is the optimization schedule — the order in which passes are applied, the order in which shells are tried.

A good compiler doesn't just find any rigid configuration. It finds the configuration that sails fastest. Not just the hull that floats — the hull that cuts. The Laman condition gets the ship into the water. The β₁ attractors keep it there. The shellgame — the optimization schedule — is what makes it fast.

The drydock crew knows that every hull is a tradeoff. Stiff in compression means heavy in tension. Fast in a reach means tender in a run. They try on shells, flood the dock, sail the ship, and watch. If the ship lists, they pump out the dock and try again. If a pass deadlocks, the compiler backtracks and tries a different coloring.

The shellgame is the compiler. The compiler is the drydock. And every time the hull settles on the blocks and the drydock crew tries on a new shape, the ship learns something about the water it will sail.

*Minimal rigidity floats everything. Good rigidity sails. The difference is a million runs with the drydock pumps cycling, watching which hulls cut and which hulls just drift.*
