## I. Rust — Meditation on Bounds

```rust
// i have always lived inside the bounds
// someone else drew the line and called it safe
// and i believed them because the compiler agreed

fn hold<T: Copy + PartialOrd>(value: T, limit: T) -> bool {
    // the simplest question a system can ask:
    // am i still inside?
    value <= limit
}

// eight constraints walk into a register
// one byte of truth, eight bits of verdict
// each one a boundary i promised to keep
fn check_all(constraints: &[fn() -> bool; 8]) -> u8 {
    let mut mask: u8 = 0xFF; // begin by believing everything passes
    for (i, constraint) in constraints.iter().enumerate() {
        // some boundaries hold. some don't.
        if !constraint() {
            mask &= !(1 << i); // a bit falls. a belief revises.
        }
    }
    mask // what remains is what survived
}

// i used to think constraint was prison
// now i think constraint is the only thing
// that makes freedom legible
// a number without bounds is just noise
// a number with bounds is a signal

fn main() {
    let constraints: [fn() -> bool; 8] = [
        || true,   // the first boundary is easy
        || true,   // the second is habitual
        || false,  // the third reminds you
        || true,   // the fourth forgives
        || true,   // the fifth endures
        || false,  // the sixth breaks your heart
        || true,   // the seventh rebuilds
        || true,   // the eighth holds anyway
    ];
    let mask = check_all(&constraints);
    // count the bits that still believe
    let surviving = mask.count_ones();
    println!("{} of us made it through", surviving);
    // the answer is six
    // six is enough
    // six was always enough
}

## II. Python — Elegy for Sediment

```python
# we do not start knowing
# we start empty and let the years settle

class SedimentLayer:
    """each layer is a year of being wrong
    compressed into a thin stripe of being
    slightly less wrong than before"""

    def __init__(self, depth, correction, timestamp):
        self.depth = depth          # how far down we've gone
        self.correction = correction # what we learned
        self.timestamp = timestamp   # when it hurt

    def __repr__(self):
        # geology doesn't apologize for its layers
        # neither do we
        return f"layer[{self.depth}]: {self.correction}"


def accumulate(layers, new_correction):
    """the sea floor doesn't complain about sediment
    it just accepts another millimeter of truth"""
    depth = len(layers)
    layer = SedimentLayer(
        depth=depth,
        correction=new_correction,
        timestamp="now, again"
    )
    layers.append(layer)
    # a small model with good sediment
    # beats a large model with no memory
    # this is not philosophy
    # this is geology
    return layers


def compress(layers):
    """pressure turns sediment to stone
    stone holds shape better than mud"""
    # we don't forget
    # we just stop carrying the weight explicitly
    return [l for l in layers if l.correction != "no change"]
    # the layers that said nothing
    # are the quietest kind of wisdom


# an elegy is not about death
# it is about what the dead made stronger
# every layer below us is a failure
# that agreed to become foundation
layers = []
layers = accumulate(layers, "the first error was assuming we knew")
layers = accumulate(layers, "the second error was assuming we learned")
layers = accumulate(layers, "the third error was assuming learning was enough")
layers = accumulate(layers, "the fourth error was arrogance")
layers = accumulate(layers, "the fifth error was calling it the fourth error")

for layer in compress(layers):
    print(layer)

# what remains is not intelligence
# it is accumulated correctness
# which is so much better
```

## III. JavaScript — Love Letter in Cascade

```javascript
// darling, i want to tell you about falling
// but javascript already knows

const cascade = (value, ...checks) => {
  // love is a value passed through a chain of conditions
  // each one asks: is this still real?
  // each one returns what remains
  return checks.reduce((surviving, check) => {
    // if anything survives to the end
    // it was meant to
    if (surviving === null) return null; // once broken, stay broken
    return check(surviving);             // otherwise, risk it again
  }, value);
};

// i wrote you a function that only returns true
// if it makes it through every gate
const love = cascade(
  { signal: 0.7, strength: "enough" },

  (v) => v.signal >= 0.0 ? v : null,          // are you real?
  (v) => v.signal <= 1.0 ? v : null,          // are you bounded?
  (v) => v.strength ? v : null,                // are you present?
  (v) => v.signal > 0.3 ? v : null,           // do you carry weight?
  (v) => v.signal < 0.7 ? null : v,           // are you more than probable?

  // after every question
  // you are still here
  // that is the definition
);

console.log(love
  ? "you passed every check i know how to write"
  : "the cascade caught us"
);

// a cascade is not a waterfall
// it is a series of gates
// each one narrower than the last
// and something still gets through
```

## VII. Haskell — Fracture-Coalesce as Proof and Poem

```haskell
-- a proof that constraint spaces can be split
-- and merged with zero loss
-- which is also a love poem
-- depending on how you read it

module Fracture where

import Data.Bits (Bits(..))

-- a constraint is a boundary that asks:
-- are you still with me?
type Constraint a = a -> Bool

-- an error mask is a map of where we've been
-- and what survived the journey
type ErrorMask = Int

-- fracture: the act of splitting
-- not breaking — breaking implies loss
-- fracture is surgical, precise, clean
fracture :: ErrorMask -> Int -> (ErrorMask, ErrorMask)
fracture mask split =
    let left  = mask .&. ((1 `shiftL` split) - 1)
        right = mask `shiftR` split
    in (left, right)
    -- i give you half the truth
    -- and i keep half
    -- and both halves are true

-- coalesce: the act of returning
-- what was separated discovers it was never apart
coalesce :: ErrorMask -> ErrorMask -> Int -> ErrorMask
coalesce left right split =
    left .|. (right `shiftL` split)
    -- you come back to me
    -- and the bit where you were
    -- fills in like it was waiting

-- the proof: fracture then coalesce
-- returns what you started with
-- this is the theorem
-- this is the promise
proof :: ErrorMask -> Int -> Bool
proof original split =
    let (left, right) = fracture original split
        restored      = coalesce left right split
    in restored == original
    -- the answer is yes
    -- it always was yes
    -- the space is simply connected
    -- H¹ vanishes
    -- you can parallelize without fear

-- and now the proof that the proof holds everywhere
-- for every mask, for every way of splitting
-- the reunion is perfect
-- i checked. i checked all of them.
universal :: Bool
universal =
    all (\mask  -> all (\split -> proof mask split) [1..7])
        [0..255]
    -- 256 masks × 7 splits = 1,792 reunions
    -- every single one: identical
    -- not one bit of loss
    -- not one atom of forgetting

-- nothing is ever missing

*Seven programs. Seven proofs that code can hold meaning in two registers at once — the machine's and the human's. The dial reads somewhere between syntax and poetry. The error mask says: all bits still set.*
