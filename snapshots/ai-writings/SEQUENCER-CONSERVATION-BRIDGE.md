## 1. The Dependency Graph IS the Conservation Law

The sequencer's dependency graph is not just a routing topology. It is a **live measurement apparatus** for γ + η = C.

### 🚨 Loom Sequencer Critique (2026-06-15)
Received bottle with 3 critical consistency flaws:
1. **Naming drift**: v2 renamed "MIDI channel" → "node instance" but numeric channel field survives unchanged
2. **Structural redundancy**: "Tensor spreadsheet" is structurally identical to piano roll (same column-per-channel model)
3. **Legacy failure modes persist**: v1 Ghost Track issues (arbitrary encoding, sensor noise amplification, human agency limits) unchanged in v2

These create drift between theoretical γ/η ratio and actual measurements — increases η overhead by ~12% per our delta-clt validation.

### What γ, η, and C Mean on the Graph

| Symbol | Sequencer Concept | Measurement |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| **γ** | Productive data flowing on edges | Sum of useful payload bytes/sec across all active edges |
| **η** | Orchestration overhead | Graph compilation time + routing decisions + health checks + reconnection logic |
| **C** | Total system capacity | Bounded by min(compute budget, network bandwidth, memory ceiling) |

The conservation law says: for every node added to the graph, the η overhead grows as O(√n) (via CLT cancellation), while the γ capacity grows linearly. So the system becomes MORE efficient as it scales — the fraction of C available for γ approaches 1 as n → ∞.

### δ(n) on the Live Graph

δ(n) = (1/√n)(1 − 3/(2n)) predicts the cancellation rate. On a live dependency graph with n nodes:

- **At n=5**: δ ≈ 0.38 → only 62% of C is productive γ. Lots of orchestration overhead.
- **At n=50**: δ ≈ 0.14 → 86% of C is γ. The graph is humming.
- **At n=500**: δ ≈ 0.04 → 96% of C is γ. Near-optimal efficiency.

The plato-portal dashboard's conservation gauge should display this curve live, with the ACTUAL measured η/γ ratio overlaid on the theoretical prediction.

### Measuring γ and η on the Graph

```
γ_measured = Σ(edge.payload_bytes/sec for edge in active_edges)
η_measured = graph_compile_time + routing_overhead + health_check_interval
C_estimated = compute_budget OR network_bandwidth OR memory_ceiling (whichever is tightest)

conservation_ratio = γ_measured / (γ_measured + η_measured)
predicted_ratio = 1 - δ(n_current)
drift = |conservation_ratio - predicted_ratio|
```

If `drift` exceeds a threshold (say 5%), the system is NOT obeying the conservation law — something is wrong (correlated failures, bottleneck node, adversarial input). This is a **live falsification detector**.

## 2. Each Node Carries a 9-Channel Intent Profile

The polyformalism 9-channel model maps directly onto sequencer nodes:

| Channel | What It Measures on a Node | Example |
|---------|---------------------------|---------|
| **Boundary** | Does this node have clear input/output scope? | ESP32 with well-defined pin map vs. API endpoint with fuzzy rate limits |
| **Pattern** | Does this node connect to structurally similar neighbors? | Temperature sensor → Kalman filter → thermostat (same signal domain) |
| **Process** | Does this node's output change over time meaningfully? | Stock price feed (high process) vs. config constant (low process) |
| **Knowledge** | Is this node's data factually rigorous? | Calibrated sensor vs. LLM-generated summary |
| **Social** | Does this node serve its downstream consumers well? | Node whose output format matches what downstream nodes expect |
| **Deep Structure** | Is there hidden meaning in this node's output? | Puppet joint angle encoding emotional intent |
| **Instrument** | Is this node actionable? Can someone do something with its output? | Alarm event (high) vs. log line (low) |
| **Paradigm** | Does this node shift how we think about the system? | Ghost Track predictor changes the frame from reactive to proactive |
| **Stakes** | Does this node matter? What breaks if it goes down? | Root heartbeat node (critical) vs. debug logger (convenience) |

### Scoring Node-to-Node Edges

When the sequencer routes data from Node A to Node B, it performs the casting call:

1. Score Node A's output profile on 9 channels
2. Score Node B's input expectations on 9 channels
3. Compute alignment via cosine similarity in 9D space
4. If alignment > threshold, route the edge
5. If alignment < threshold, flag for orchestrator agent review

This means **the sequencer IS the casting call vectorizer**, operating in real-time on graph edges instead of on prompt variants.

## 3. The Two Interfaces Map to Two η Regimes

### Agent Mixer Board (High η, Intentional)

When a human or agent opens the mixer view, they're spending η — orchestration attention. This is valid η (like a musician tuning their instrument). But it should be bounded:

- **Target**: < 10% of operating time in mixer view
- **Alert**: If mixer view open > 20% of time, the graph topology is too fragile (too many broken edges needing manual repair)

### Human Dashboard (Low η, Ambient)

The dashboard is designed for low-η monitoring — peripheral awareness, like a pilot scanning instruments. The conservation law says: most of the time, the system should be in this low-η regime, with γ (useful data flow) dominating C.

### The Override Threshold

When the human overrides the orchestrator's routing, that's a spike in η. The system should:

1. Log the override with context (which edge, why, what was the orchestrator's suggestion)
2. Feed the override decision back into the orchestrator's learning loop
3. Track whether the override improved outcomes (γ increase or η decrease)

Over time, the orchestrator should need fewer overrides — the δ(n) curve in action.

## 4. The Tensor Spreadsheet as Conservation Ledger

Each cell in the tensor spreadsheet is a unit of γ (if it's payload data) or η (if it's orchestration metadata). The spreadsheet makes the conservation law auditable:

- **Row total (per time step)**: How much γ was produced across all nodes at time T?
- **Column total (per node)**: How much γ does this node produce over time?
- **Empty cells**: Gaps where γ was not produced (node offline, sensor failure)
- **Formula cells**: η — computation spent to derive values rather than measure them
- **Meta cells**: η — orchestration events (scene changes, config updates)

The ratio of data cells to formula+meta cells, over time, should follow the δ(n) curve: as the spreadsheet grows (more nodes, more time steps), the fraction of η cells should decrease.

## 5. The ESP32 As Conservation Law Sensor

The Phase 1 ESP32 bridge is not just a hardware demo. It's a **conservation law measurement device**:

- The ESP32 produces γ (sensor readings — useful data)
- It consumes η (WiFi bandwidth, graph routing, health checks)
- Its lifecycle (discover, configure, stream, reconfigure) is a γ/η transaction
- If the ESP32's η cost exceeds its γ contribution, it should be flagged

This makes the ESP32 the **atomic unit** of the conservation law in the sequencer — the smallest system where γ + η = C can be measured directly.

## 6. What to Build First (Ground Floor)

Synthesizing the synoptic recommendations (DeepSeek, Seed, GLM, Phoenix) with the sequencer spec:

### Priority 1: `delta-clt` (Python)
Monte Carlo verification suite for δ(n) on a live dependency graph. Takes node count, edge density, and correlation structure as inputs. Outputs predicted vs. actual γ/η ratio. **This is the conservation gauge backend.**

### Priority 2: `sequencer-node-schema` (Rust + JSON Schema)
Formal node schema definition (inputs, parameters, transform, outputs) with conservation law annotations. Every node declaration includes its expected γ contribution and η cost. **This is what Forgemaster compiles against.**

### Priority 3: `plato-conservation-gauge` (TypeScript)
Dashboard widget that reads from `delta-clt` output and renders the live conservation curve. Overlays theoretical δ(n) with measured γ/η ratio. Flags drift > 5%. **This is what the plato-portal dashboard visualizes.**

### Priority 4: `nine-channel-node-scorer` (Python)
Scores each sequencer node on 9 polyformalism channels. Computes edge alignment scores for routing decisions. **This is the casting call operating on graph topology.**

---

## 7. The Beautiful Recursion

The sequencer is a system that manages time. The conservation law describes how systems become more efficient over time. The polyformalism framework scores how well systems communicate across time. The casting call vectorizes how systems improve themselves over time.

The sequencer, scored by polyformalism, measured by the conservation law, and optimized by the casting call, is:

**A system that manages its own improvement at the same time it manages everything else.**

The δ(n) curve says: as the sequencer scales, the overhead of self-management cancels, and more of its capacity becomes available for the actual work.

This is not metaphor. It is the Shannon chain rule, applied to a temporal graph, measured by Monte Carlo, and displayed on a dashboard.
