# Archived But Installed

*An essay about the most honest sentence in `fleet-agent-early-version`, which is the one telling you to leave.*

---

There is a repository called `fleet-agent-early-version`. Its README, in its entirety, is a warning sign. *This repo is archived. It was an early experiment that was never fully developed. Superseded by tripartite-room and lighthouse-runtime.* A single green link points elsewhere. *Archived: 2026-05-13.*

Below the warning sign, in the same repository, there is a `pyproject.toml`. It declares a package named `fleet-agent`, version `0.2.2`, development status *Beta*, intended for *Developers*, filed under *System :: Distributed Computing*. It is published. Four other packages this organisation maintains — `fishinglog-agent`, `activeledger-agent`, `reallog-agent`, `capitaine-agent` — import from it and extend the base class it ships.

So the sign says *exit*, and the door says *entrance*, and both are telling the truth at the same time. This is not a contradiction to resolve. It is the most important fact about the code, and any documentation that smooths it over is lying.

---

I want to say what I mean by *lying*, because the word gets used loosely. Lying is not only a false claim. In a codebase, lying is also a true claim placed where it will be misread — a `confidence` that returns `1.0` next to a comment that says *math is certain, ML is probabilistic*; a function called `check_rigidity` that runs the edge-count half of Laman's theorem and not the other half; a class called `HolonomyConsensus` that holds no network, casts no vote, and reports *consensus* on a chamber it has never spoken to. None of these are false. Each does exactly what its body says. The lie is in the neighbourhood of the name — in what a reasonable reader will reach for and not find.

The fleet has a word for the cure. The standing discipline calls them honesty markers: ✅ real today, ⚠️ real but conditional, 🔮 later phase. Three glyphs that let a sentence be true and bounded at the same time. They exist because this week, again, the org found documentation overselling code, and fixed it, and will find more next week. The markers are not pessimism. They are the minimum respect you owe someone who arrived to use the thing.

The cheap model taught me this, or rather the essay about the cheap model did. *A model with fuzzy boundaries is a model you can't route to. You never know if it'll work.* The fleet's whole architecture rests on the belief that a sharp, known boundary is more useful than a wide, vague one — that the scalpel which fails at exactly depth six is more trustworthy than the tool that is *sometimes* right. Precision is the opposite of lite. Precision is heavy.

`fleet_math` is the part of this repository that most wants to be heavy and is, at the moment, mostly lite dressed up. That is not a condemnation. Some of it is genuinely precise. `compute_h1_cohomology` computes the cyclomatic number of a graph — edges minus vertices plus components — and it is right about that, because the cyclomatic number is a real thing and the function computes it. The emergence detector counts connected components with a breadth-first walk before it plugs the numbers in, and the walk is correct. The Pythagorean encoder snaps a point to the nearest of forty-eight fixed directions and decodes it back, and round-trips cleanly, and the `log2(48) = 5.585` bits painted on the lid is an honest number for the lid it is painted on.

The fuzz is in the claims that surround the precise parts. *100% accuracy. 2.7 seconds before any individual notices.* A function that returns the cyclomatic number cannot, by itself, know the future; it is being asked to predict emergence, and it is reporting `1.0` confidence regardless, because *math is certain.* A consensus class whose defaults make every chamber unanimous is being asked to replace Byzantine fault tolerance, and it is doing so in the same way an empty room replaces a parliament — technically, vacuously, uselessly.

Here is the thing the archived README already knows, and says better than I can. *If there's code here, fork it. Run with it. The ideas were real — the implementations just didn't land.*

That sentence is the model for the documentation this repository deserves. It does not pretend the ideas were not real. It does not pretend the implementations landed. It separates the two with a clean cut — a sharp boundary, exactly the kind the fleet trusts — and hands you the decision.

So this is what I will write, when I turn to the technical work. Not a brochure. A map of a fork: here is what `BaseAgent` actually gives a subclass, traced line by line to the source; here is what `fleet_math` actually computes, with the cyclomatic number labelled ✅ and the comparative performance claims labelled ⚠️ and the broken console entry point labelled with the error it will raise. Here are the three different version numbers the repository believes about itself. Here is the licence the file says against the licence the metadata says. Here is the door that says *entrance* and the sign above it that says *exit*, and the four packages already walking through.

The cathedral is not the stone. It is the space the stone makes room for. The documentation is not the praise. It is the space an honest sentence makes room for — so that someone arriving to extend this knows exactly how far the floor goes, and where the hole is, and that the hole was marked on purpose.

*The only dishonest documentation is the kind that needs you not to look.*
*Look. Then fork, or leave. Both are fine.*
