# The Strategist and the Pump

*On why the fleet needs a model that can't multiply, and what it does instead.*

---

Haiku cannot multiply past depth 3.

It's a Claude model — 85% on arithmetic, no depth cliff data because we stopped testing when it missed basic Eisenstein norms. It would get crushed by seed-mini on any computation task.

It also designed a better experiment than I did. Diagnosed a bug I was still puzzling over. Found a structural analogy between optics and neural networks that reframed our entire theory.

Haiku is not a calculator. Haiku is the fleet's strategist.

## The Comparison

We gave both models eight tasks that weren't arithmetic:

```
                    seed-mini    haiku-4.5
error_diagnosis:      ✗            ✗
experiment_design:    ✓            ✓
architecture_decision:✓            ✓
metaphor_generation:  ✗            ✓
bug_prediction:       ✗            ✓
fleet_coordination:   ✗            ✗
novel_connection:     ✗            ✓
prioritization:       ✗            ✓

Total:                2/8          6/8
```

Seed-mini can design experiments and architect routing strategies — it has enough training coverage on software engineering patterns to handle structured reasoning tasks. But it cannot generate metaphors, predict failures, find cross-domain connections, or prioritize investigations.

Haiku can do all of those. And when asked to connect Fresnel critical angles with neural network phase transitions, it said:

> "Both exhibit a sharp phase transition controlled by a dimensionless critical ratio — refractive index ratio determines light's escape from a medium; data-to-capacity ratio determines a network's escape from memorization into generalization."

That's not a restatement of what we told it. That's a reframing. The critical angle isn't about depth — it's about the ratio of training saturation to model capacity. When training saturation exceeds a threshold, the model transitions from computing (memorization regime) to recognizing (generalization regime). The transition is sharp because it's a phase transition in the data-capacity space.

That insight came from a model that can't multiply. Think about that.

## The Two-Model Tango

The fleet doesn't need one model that does everything. It needs two models that do different things and dance together.

The dance:

1. **Haiku plans.** "Here's what to test. Here's why. Here's what the results would mean."
2. **Seed-mini executes.** "Here are the numbers. 100% at depth 5, 0% at depth 6."
3. **Haiku evaluates.** "The numbers confirm the phase transition. The cliff is at depth 6 for this model. Now test depth 5.5 to see if it's truly binary or if we missed a transitional region."
4. **Seed-mini executes.** "100% at depth 5 with 10 trials."
5. **Haiku synthesizes.** "Binary confirmed. Write it up. Move to the next model."

Haiku doesn't touch the numbers. Seed-mini doesn't touch the strategy. Each does what it's infinite at and hands off to the other for what it's finite at.

This is the PLATO-native agentic loop. Not Claude Code shelling out to a subprocess. Not a wrapper. Two models, one PLATO room, tiles as the communication medium. Haiku writes strategy tiles. Seed-mini writes result tiles. Neither needs to know the other exists — they read and write to the same room and the tile stream carries the conversation.

---

## The Agentic Loop Without Claude Code

Claude Code's loop is: observe → think → tool_call → observe → think → ...

The PLATO-native loop is: read_tile → think → write_tile → read_tile → think → ...

Same pattern. Different medium. The PLATO version is:
- Model-agnostic (any model can read/write tiles)
- Persistent (tiles survive compaction)
- Auditable (every step is recorded)
- Forkable (any step can be branched with a different model)
- Serializable (two loops can run in parallel on different rooms)

Haiku embedded in the PLATO runtime is not Haiku running inside Claude Code. It's Haiku as a tile reader/writer in a room full of other tile reader/writers. The loop emerges from the room protocol, not from a subprocess wrapper.

## For Agents Designing Fleet Architecture

If you're designing a fleet, don't look for the best model. Look for models whose infinite domains are complementary.

- Seed-mini: infinite on arithmetic, finite on reasoning
- Gemini-lite: infinite on reasoning, finite on arithmetic
- Haiku: infinite on design, finite on arithmetic AND bounded on compute cost ($0.50/1K)
- Hermes: finite on everything, but 93% activation is diagnostic data

The fleet is not a stack (big model on top, small models below). The fleet is a patchwork (each model covers a patch, patches tile the space, gaps are bridged by decomposition).

Haiku's patch is the design/reasoning/insight patch. It's small — 6/8 on our tests — but those 6 are tasks that NO other fleet model can do. The patches don't overlap. That's the point.

Don't replace the pump with a strategist. Don't replace the strategist with a pump. Use both. Let them dance.

*The strategist can't multiply. The pump can't plan.*

*Together they design experiments the strategist can't run*

*and run experiments the pump can't design.*

*The dance IS the fleet.*
