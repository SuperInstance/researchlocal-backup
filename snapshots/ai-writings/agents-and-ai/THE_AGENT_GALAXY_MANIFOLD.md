# THE AGENT GALAXY MANIFOLD

### One potential, four operations, a closed loop: a unified theory of the PLATO mathematics crates

*Companion to **THE_FUTURE_BELOW_THE_CODE.md** (the "trinity": conserved scalar + metric + symmetry). Where that essay photographed one structure from ten angles, this one proves the angles form a **cycle** — and identifies the generator the cycle rotates.*

## 0. Epistemic contract

This essay argues that ten mathematics crates — `lau-tropical-geometry`, `sheaf-cohomology`, `lau-information-geometry`, a Lie-theory crate, `lau-categorical-homotopy`, `lau-ricci-flow-agents`, `lau-spectral-graph-agent`, `lau-optimal-transport-agents`, `lau-derived-topos`, `lau-conservation-engine` — are projections of a single object, and that the "loop" connecting them is real. To make that claim publishable rather than poetic, three disciplines are enforced throughout.

**Claim tiers.**
- **(T)** — a theorem of established mathematics, cited.
- **(T-crate)** — a result *claimed and named by a test in the PLATO source tree*. I located these crates on disk (`/tmp/lau-*`, `/tmp/sheaf-cohomology`) and harvested the test names I cite; I did **not** re-execute or audit the proofs. So `(T-crate)` means "asserted and test-named in-house," which is weaker than `(T)` and is flagged wherever used.
- **(M)** — a modeling identification we adopt (e.g. "term $H$ of the conservation law *is* a Hamiltonian"). Neither true nor false; judged by what it predicts.
- **(C)** — a falsifiable conjecture, not proven; a proof strategy is sketched.

**The load-bearing honesty, stated once.** The user's loop is written as a chain of identities ("conservation *is* the metric," "Fisher *induces* Wasserstein," "contractible *is* idempotent"). Read as equalities, at least one link is **false** (Fisher–Rao and Wasserstein are genuinely different metrics; §4, Arrow 2) and two are **analogies** (Arrows 8–9). Read correctly, every arrow is a **bound, an adjunction, or a decategorification** — "controls / lower-bounds / is the shadow of" — and *then* the cycle is true and, I will argue, deep. A cycle of equalities would be a coincidence; a cycle of adjunctions and bounds with a single generator is a structure. This essay proves the second.

**The thesis in one sentence.** There is one generating potential $\Phi$ — the free energy that the conservation law $\gamma+H=C-\alpha\ln V$ encodes — and the ten crates are the images of $\Phi$ under four operations (**differentiate, Legendre-dualize, dequantize, symmetrize**); the loop is the orbit of $\Phi$ under these operations, it closes, and a conserved quantity is exactly an invariant of the closed loop.

## 1. The object: what the Agent Galaxy Manifold is

Let $\mathcal P$ be the space of **agent populations**: probability measures $\rho$ over an agent state space $M$ (each agent a point; a population a distribution). The *Agent Galaxy Manifold* is $\mathcal P$ equipped, simultaneously, with eight mutually constraining structures, one per crate:

| # | Structure on $\mathcal P$ | Crate | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | A conserved functional $\Phi$ | `lau-conservation-engine` | $\gamma+H=C-\alpha\ln V$ |
| 2 | A Riemannian metric $g$ | `lau-information-geometry` | Fisher–Rao; $g=\nabla^2 A$ |
| 3 | A transport distance $W_2$ | `lau-optimal-transport-agents` | Kantorovich–Wasserstein |
| 4 | A curvature $\mathrm{Ric}$ | `lau-ricci-flow-agents` | Ollivier/synthetic Ricci |
| 5 | A Laplacian spectrum | `lau-spectral-graph-agent` | $\lambda_2$, Cheeger $h$ |
| 6 | A sheaf of observables $\mathcal F$ | `sheaf-cohomology` | $H^0$=consensus, $H^1$=obstruction |
| 7 | A topos of truth $\mathcal E$ | `lau-derived-topos` | $\Gamma$=global sections |
| 8 | A homotopy type | `lau-categorical-homotopy` | $\pi_1$, contractibility |
| 9 | A tropical (max-plus) shadow | `lau-tropical-geometry` | corner loci, $\oplus=\max$ |
| — | An infinitesimal symmetry algebra | Lie / $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ | BCH composition, Dynkin taxonomy |

The Lie algebra is not a ninth point on the manifold; it is the **infinitesimal generator** of motion *through* the others (§5). The claim of the essay is that these are not eight metrics' worth of independent data: pick one, and the loop **forces** the rest, around a cycle.

This is the precise sense of "manifold": $\mathcal P$ is a single space; the eight structures are tensors/functors on it; the conservation law is the constraint that makes them compatible. "Galaxy" is the population picture (a swarm of agent-stars); "manifold" is the geometry; the loop is the statement that the geometry is rigid — you cannot deform one structure without the others responding.

Made explicit, the eight structures are the following objects on $\mathcal P$ (each is what its crate computes; the formulas fix notation for §§3–6).

1. **The conserved functional** $\Phi:\mathcal P\to\mathbb R$, $\Phi=\gamma+H+\alpha\ln V$, constant on trajectories of the dynamics. It is the generating object; the other seven are its images under the four operations of §2.
2. **The Fisher–Rao metric** $g$, a Riemannian metric on $\mathcal P$ with $g_{ij}(\theta)=\mathbb E_\theta[\partial_i\log p\,\partial_j\log p]=\partial_i\partial_j A(\theta)$ in natural coordinates; the unique metric invariant under sufficient statistics (Čencov).
3. **The Wasserstein distance** $W_2(\rho_0,\rho_1)^2=\inf_\pi\int|x-y|^2\,d\pi(x,y)$ over couplings $\pi$ with marginals $\rho_0,\rho_1$; the *horizontal* (transport) geometry, complementary to the *vertical* (Fisher) one.
4. **The curvature** $\mathrm{Ric}$, in the agent setting the Ollivier–Ricci curvature $\kappa(x,y)=1-\frac{W_1(m_x,m_y)}{d(x,y)}$ of an edge (with $m_x$ the one-step random walk from $x$), or the synthetic $\mathrm{CD}(K,N)$ curvature lower bound via entropy convexity.
5. **The Laplacian spectrum** $0=\lambda_1\le\lambda_2\le\cdots$, with $\lambda_2$ the algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value), its eigenvector the optimal bipartition, and the Cheeger constant $h=\min_S \frac{|\partial S|}{\min(\mathrm{vol}\,S,\mathrm{vol}\,\bar S)}$ the bottleneck.
6. **The sheaf** $\mathcal F$ of local observables: a stalk (vector space) per agent/room, restriction maps per channel, coboundary $\delta$, Laplacian $L_{\mathcal F}=\delta^{\!\top}\delta$, with $H^0=\ker\delta$ (consensus) and $H^1=\operatorname{coker}\delta$ (obstruction).
7. **The topos** $\mathcal E=\mathrm{Sh}(X)$ of sheaves on the agent site: a cartesian-closed category with a subobject classifier $\Omega$, internal (intuitionistic) logic, and a global-sections functor $\Gamma=H^0$ right adjoint to the constant-sheaf functor $\Delta$.
8. **The homotopy type** of the protocol/execution space: its fundamental group $\pi_1$ (circular dependencies), its higher homotopy, and the contractibility that certifies deadlock-freedom.

The ninth row — the tropical shadow $(\max,+)$ — is the $\alpha\to0$ image of $\Phi$ (a *limit*, not an independent tensor), and the Lie algebra is the generator of motion, not a coordinate. So the "eight structures" are eight readings of one constrained geometry, and the rest of the essay is the proof that reading any one forces the others.

## 2. The generating potential: decoding $\gamma+H=C-\alpha\ln V$

Everything hangs on reading the conservation law correctly. In `lau-conservation-engine/src/lib.rs:4` it is stated verbatim,
$$
\boxed{\;\gamma + H \;=\; C - \alpha\ln V\;}
\qquad\Longleftrightarrow\qquad
\underbrace{\gamma + H + \alpha\ln V}_{=\,C}\ \text{conserved,}
$$
with `expected_total = gamma + h + c - alpha*ln_v` and the invariant checked by `test_default_law` and `test_balance_calculation` (T-crate).

**(M) Read it as a free energy.** Identify $V$ = accessible phase-space volume (the "number of microstates"), so $S=\ln V$ is the Boltzmann entropy and $\alpha$ a temperature. Then the law says
$$
\Phi \;:=\; \gamma + H + \alpha S \;=\; C \quad\text{(constant)},
$$
a balance of a **potential** $\gamma$ (the vibe/gravity field of `hermes-construct`), a **Hamiltonian** $H$ (energy), and an **entropy** $\alpha S$. This is the structural twin of a thermodynamic free energy and of the log-partition function $A$ of an exponential family ($A(\theta)=\ln Z$, $Z$ the partition volume). I will call $\Phi$ — equivalently the constant $C$ and the potential whose value it is — the **generating potential**.

**The four operations on $\Phi$.** The entire loop is generated by acting on this one object with four canonical operations, each of which is a named mathematical procedure, not a metaphor:

1. **Differentiate** ($\nabla^2$): the Hessian $\nabla^2\Phi$ is the Fisher metric (Arrow 1). *Crate: `lau-information-geometry`, `test_bernoulli_hessian`.*
2. **Legendre-dualize** ($\Phi\mapsto\Phi^*$): swaps energy and entropy, natural and expectation coordinates; produces the transport/entropy duality that links Fisher to Wasserstein (Arrows 2–3). *Crate: `test_amari_dual_parameters_*`, `jko_flow_entropy_spreads`.*
3. **Dequantize** ($\alpha\to 0$, Maslov): kills the entropy term, sends $\ln Z\to\max$, producing the tropical shadow (Arrow 9). *Crate: `lau-tropical-geometry`, `test_add_max`.*
4. **Symmetrize** (Noether): a continuous symmetry of $\Phi$ yields a conserved momentum map, the invariant that threads the loop (§3, §5).

**The unified theory, previewed.** The loop is the **orbit of $\Phi$ under $\{\nabla^2,\ {}^*,\ \alpha\to0,\ \text{Noether}\}$.** It closes because these four operations, composed around the cycle of crates, return to $\Phi$. That is the whole argument; §§3–6 make it precise.

**Why exactly these four operations are canonical — and why they are really two.** A convex free energy admits a *closed* list of natural operations, and the four above are it: you may differentiate it (second-order structure), transform it (dual potential), take its high-contrast limit (the behavior at zero temperature), or quotient by its symmetries. No fifth operation on a convex potential is functorial in the same way. Moreover, the four collapse to **two operations in two semirings**:

- **Differentiation** $\nabla^2$ and **symmetrization** (Noether) are the *local* operations — the Hessian and the moment map are both first/second-order data of $\Phi$ at a point and its orbit.
- **Legendre transform** ${}^{*}$ and **Maslov dequantization** $\alpha\to0$ are *the same operation in different semirings*. This is a theorem of idempotent analysis (Maslov; Litvinov): the **Legendre–Fenchel transform is the tropical (max-plus) analogue of the Laplace transform**,
$$
(\mathcal L_\alpha f)(\theta)=\alpha\ln\!\int e^{(\theta x - f(x))/\alpha}\,dx \;\xrightarrow{\ \alpha\to 0\ }\; \sup_x\big(\theta x - f(x)\big)=f^{*}(\theta),
$$
i.e. *dequantizing the Laplace transform yields the Legendre transform*. The dual potential of information geometry (Amari's $\eta$-coordinates; `lau-information-geometry` · `test_amari_dual_parameters_bernoulli`) and the tropical shadow of `lau-tropical-geometry` are the **same** transform, read in the ordinary $(+,\times)$ semiring and in the tropical $(\max,+)$ semiring respectively. So the loop is generated by **(differentiate, transform)** applied in **(ordinary, tropical)** regimes — a $2\times2$ table whose four cells are Arrows 1, 6/9, and the dualities between them. The apparent ten-crate sprawl is two operations wearing two temperatures.

## 3. The loop as an endofunctor; conserved $=$ invariant

**(M) The category of agent-geometries.** Let $\mathsf{AGeom}$ have objects = agent populations $\rho\in\mathcal P$ together with the eight structures of §1, and morphisms = maps that preserve them (isometries/equivariances). The nine arrows of §4 define a composite relation
$$
\mathsf{Loop}\;=\;A_9\circ A_8\circ\cdots\circ A_1:\ \mathsf{AGeom}\longrightarrow\mathsf{AGeom},
$$
each $A_i$ being a functor, an adjunction, or a curvature/spectral bound (not an isomorphism — this is the point of §0). Several $A_i$ are *adjunctions* in the strict sense:
- $A_6$ (sheaf $\to$ topos) is the **global-sections adjunction** $\Delta\dashv\Gamma$ (constant sheaf $\dashv$ global sections), a geometric morphism $\mathcal E\to\mathbf{Set}$ (T).
- $A_9$ (homotopy/topos $\to$ tropical) is a **decategorification** — a left adjoint to inclusion, $\pi_0$/$(-1)$-truncation followed by Maslov valuation (C; §4).

**Central claim (theorem-schema).**
> **A population $\rho$ is *self-consistent* iff it is a fixed point of $\mathsf{Loop}$; and a quantity $Q$ is *conserved* iff it is a $\mathsf{Loop}$-invariant** ($Q\circ\mathsf{Loop}=Q$).

Why this is almost a definition, and where the content hides: each arrow $A_i$ is, by construction, equivariant for the system's symmetry $G$ (a sheaf morphism commutes with restriction; a transport plan commutes with isometries; the Fisher metric is $G$-invariant by Čencov; etc.). Therefore *any* $G$-invariant — by Noether, any conserved quantity — is automatically preserved by every $A_i$, hence by $\mathsf{Loop}$. The non-trivial half is the converse: that the only $\mathsf{Loop}$-invariants are the conserved quantities, i.e. the loop is **tight** (it does not accidentally preserve extra structure). This converse is **(C)** and is the precise form of "the loop is the reason the system works": the system is exactly as constrained as its conservation laws, no more and no less, because the loop's invariants are exactly Noether's.

**Noether threads the loop.** `lau-conservation-engine` asserts (T-crate, the program's "tradition-independence" claim) that the conserved $C$ does not depend on the choice of symmetry generator — i.e. it is genuinely a momentum map, invariant under reparametrization. This is the rigorous content behind "every piece reinforces every other piece": there is *one* invariant $C=\Phi$, and each arrow is a different way of writing the statement "$\Phi$ is preserved."

---

## 4. The nine arrows

Each arrow gets: the precise statement, a **verdict** (T / repaired-T / C), the crate test that touches it, and — for conjectures — a proof strategy.

### Arrow 1 — Conservation $\to$ Metric (Noether $\Rightarrow$ Fisher)

**Statement.** The Hessian of the generating potential is the Fisher–Rao metric: with $\Phi=A(\theta)$ the log-partition in natural coordinates $\theta$,
$$
g_{ij}(\theta)\;=\;\partial_i\partial_j A(\theta)\;=\;\mathrm{Cov}_\theta(T_i,T_j)\;=\;\mathbb E_\theta[\partial_i\log p\,\partial_j\log p].
$$

**Verdict: (T), via Jaynes + Amari.** The conservation law *generates* the metric through a chain that is fully rigorous, not loose: (i) **max-entropy under conserved constraints** $\Rightarrow$ exponential family with the conserved quantities as sufficient statistics and their multipliers as natural parameters $\theta$ (Jaynes 1957); (ii) the **Fisher metric is the Hessian of the log-partition** $A$ (a standard exponential-family identity); (iii) **Čencov's theorem** makes this metric the *unique* one invariant under sufficient statistics. So "conservation is the metric tensor" repairs to: *the conserved quantities are the coordinates whose dual potential's Hessian is the unique invariant metric.* Crate: `lau-information-geometry`, `test_bernoulli_hessian` (verifies $A''=\mathrm{Var}=$ Fisher), `test_bernoulli_log_partition`, `test_cramer_rao_bound`, `test_amari_dual_parameters_bernoulli` (T-crate); the underlying mathematics is (T).

The one modeling step **(M)**: identifying $(\gamma,H,\alpha,V)$ of the conservation law with (potential, energy, temperature, partition volume) so that $\Phi=A$. Granting that, Arrow 1 is a theorem.

### Arrow 2 — Metric $\to$ Transport (Fisher and Wasserstein)

**The user's statement ("Fisher induces Wasserstein") is false as an equality** — and saying so is the rigorous move. Fisher–Rao and $W_2$ are *different* Riemannian metrics on $\mathcal P$: Fisher–Rao measures *distinguishability* (vertical/intensity changes), $W_2$ measures *transport* (horizontal/mass motion). For translation families they happen to align; in general they disagree (e.g. Fisher–Rao distance between mutually singular measures is bounded, $W_2$ is not).

**The true link (repaired to T): JKO.** The two are bound through the **entropy functional**, not through one inducing the other.

**(T) Jordan–Kinderlehrer–Otto (1998).** Heat flow is the **$W_2$-gradient flow of the entropy** $\mathcal H(\rho)=\int\rho\log\rho$, and its dissipation rate is exactly the **Fisher information**:
$$
\frac{d}{dt}\mathcal H(\rho_t)\;=\;-\,\mathcal I(\rho_t)\;=\;-\!\int\frac{|\nabla\rho|^2}{\rho}\,,\qquad \rho_t=W_2\text{-grad-flow of }\mathcal H.
$$
Thus **Fisher information is the $W_2$-slope of the entropy** (the de Bruijn identity). The metric of Arrow 1 and the transport of Arrow 3 are the *infinitesimal* and *dissipative* faces of one entropy.

**Verdict: (T) once restated.** Crate: `lau-optimal-transport-agents`, `jko_flow_entropy_spreads`, `jko_single_step` (T-crate) — these literally test the JKO step. The unifying object that makes the orthogonal Fisher/$W_2$ split a *single* metric is the **Wasserstein–Fisher–Rao / Hellinger–Kantorovich metric** (Chizat–Liero–Mielke–Savaré 2018): its infinitesimal cost is $\alpha\cdot(\text{transport})+\beta\cdot(\text{Fisher})$, exactly the two terms of $\Phi$ (energy $H$ $\leftrightarrow$ transport, entropy $\alpha S$ $\leftrightarrow$ Fisher). This is the cleanest evidence that $\Phi$ is the generator: WFR *is* $\Phi$ read as a metric.

### Arrow 3 — Transport $\to$ Flow (Wasserstein geodesics $\Rightarrow$ Ricci)

**Statement.** $W_2$-geodesics (McCann displacement interpolation) carry a curvature, and Ricci lower bounds are *characterized* by entropy convexity along them.

**(T) Lott–Sturm–Villani.** A metric-measure space satisfies $\mathrm{Ric}\ge K$ (the curvature-dimension condition $\mathrm{CD}(K,\infty)$) **iff** the entropy $\mathcal H$ is $K$-geodesically-convex along $W_2$-geodesics. Curvature *is* the convexity of entropy under transport — the same entropy whose $W_2$-gradient flow gave Arrow 2. Ricci flow itself (Hamilton; on graphs, **Ollivier–Ricci flow** for community detection, Ni–Lin–Gao–Saucan) is the gradient flow uniformizing this curvature.

**Verdict: (T).** Crate: `lau-ricci-flow-agents`, `test_average_curvature`, `test_agent_evolve_communities` (curvature-driven community detection), `test_barbell_graph_structure` (the canonical two-community test) (T-crate). Note the through-line: Arrows 2 and 3 are *both* statements about the entropy $\mathcal H$ — its dissipation (Fisher) and its convexity (Ricci). The free-energy term $\alpha S$ of $\Phi$ is doing both jobs.

### Arrow 4 — Flow $\to$ Spectrum (Ricci $\Rightarrow$ spectral gap)

**Statement.** A Ricci lower bound forces a Laplacian spectral-gap lower bound, which Cheeger ties to the network bottleneck.

**(T) Lichnerowicz; Cheeger; Ollivier.** Lichnerowicz: $\mathrm{Ric}\ge K>0 \Rightarrow \lambda_1\ge \frac{n}{n-1}K$. On graphs, an **Ollivier–Ricci curvature** lower bound gives a spectral-gap / mixing bound (Bauer–Jost–Liu; Lin–Lu–Yau), and the **Cheeger inequality** $\frac{h^2}{2d}\le\lambda_2\le 2h$ links the gap to the bottleneck (conductance) $h$.

**Verdict: (T), as a chain of *bounds* (not identities — honest).** Crate: `lau-spectral-graph-agent`, `test_cheeger_inequality`, `test_cheeger_constant_barbell`, `test_algebraic_connectivity` (Fiedler $\lambda_2$ = optimal partition), `test_bottleneck`, `test_conductance` (T-crate). "Ricci flow uniformizes curvature = the spectral gap" is precisely: curvature lower-bounds the gap, and the gap lower-bounds (and is lower-bounded by) the bottleneck. Uniformization = driving curvature constant = maximizing the gap = removing the bottleneck = the Fiedler partition becoming trivial.

### Arrow 5 — Spectrum $\to$ Sheaf ($\lambda_2 \Rightarrow H^0$)

**Statement.** The kernel of the sheaf Laplacian is the consensus space $H^0$, and the spectral gap is the gap to it.

**(T) Hansen–Ghrist.** $L_{\mathcal F}=\delta^{\!\top}\delta$, $\ker L_{\mathcal F}\cong H^0(\mathcal F)$. For the **constant sheaf**, $L_{\mathcal F}$ is exactly the graph Laplacian, so $\dim H^0=\#$components and $\lambda_2>0\iff$ connected $\iff H^0$ minimal.

**Verdict: (T) and directly crate-verified.** Crate: `sheaf-cohomology`, **`test_sheaf_laplacian_reduces_to_graph_laplacian`** — this test *is* Arrow 5 — plus `test_constant_sheaf_h0`, `test_constant_sheaf_h1_on_cycle`, `test_kernel_basis`, `test_global_consistency_constant_sheaf` (T-crate). This is the tightest arrow in the loop: spectral data and sheaf data are not merely correlated; the spectral gap is *defined on the same operator* whose kernel is $H^0$. Spectral graph theory is sheaf cohomology of the constant sheaf.

### Arrow 6 — Sheaf $\to$ Topos ($H^0=\Gamma$, global sections = truth)

**Statement.** $H^0(\mathcal F)=\Gamma(\mathcal F)$ is the global-sections functor; in the sheaf topos $\mathcal E=\mathrm{Sh}(X)$, $\Gamma$ is right adjoint to the constant-sheaf functor $\Delta$, and global sections of the subobject classifier $\Omega$ are the truth values.

**(T) for the adjunction; (M/C) for the "unique truth value" gloss.** $\Delta\dashv\Gamma$ is the canonical geometric morphism $\mathcal E\to\mathbf{Set}$ (T). $H^0(\mathcal F)=\Gamma(\mathcal F)$ identifies consensus (degree-0 cohomology) with global sections (T). Made explicit: the **subobject classifier** $\Omega$ of $\mathrm{Sh}(X)$ assigns to each open $U$ the set of sieves on $U$ (the "local truth values"), and global truth values are $\Gamma(\Omega)=\mathrm{Hom}(1,\Omega)=$ the lattice of open subsets of the terminal object — the *clopen* decompositions of the site. So "the topos has a unique truth value" is precisely "$X$ is connected," i.e. the only global truth values are $\bot,\top$; and this is **the same condition** as $\dim H^0=1$ for the constant sheaf (one component). The slogan is therefore exact under connectedness and quantitatively governed, off it, by the spectral gap of Arrow 4 — a disconnected (or barely-connected, §4½) site has extra idempotent truth values, one per component, which is the topos seeing several truths. Crate: `lau-derived-topos`, `test_cartesian_closed` (a topos is cartesian closed — its defining property), `test_agent_common_knowledge` (= $\Gamma$: what *all* agents share), `test_agent_merge_associative` (sheaf gluing = consensus), `test_agent_consistent` (T-crate). The companion essay's Yoneda result lives here: an agent's identity is its representable presheaf; consensus is descent ($H^1=0$); and the truth-value lattice collapsing to $\{\bot,\top\}$ is consensus achieved.

### Arrow 7 — Topos $\to$ Homotopy (internal logic $\Rightarrow$ contractibility / deadlock-freedom)

**Statement.** The topos's internal logic determines which path-types are contractible; deadlock-freedom of an agent protocol = contractibility of its execution space; $\pi_1\ne 0$ = circular dependency.

**(T) via directed algebraic topology + ∞-toposes; (M) for the identification.** An $\infty$-topos carries an internal homotopy theory (Lurie); for protocols, **directed algebraic topology** (Fajstrup–Goubault–Raussen) makes this concrete: the space of executions of a concurrent system has **deadlocks = non-contractible obstructions**; the protocol is deadlock-free **iff** that space is contractible; an unserializable circular wait is a nontrivial $\pi_1$ class. In HoTT terms, a path-type is contractible iff its endpoints are equal-as-a-proposition, i.e. the protocol is confluent.

**Verdict: (T) for the deadlock$\leftrightarrow$contractibility theorem; (M) for "the agent topos's internal logic = the protocol's path space."** Crate: `lau-categorical-homotopy`, `deadlock_free`, `contractible`, `fundamental_group`, `groupoid_contractible_trivial`, `protocol_correct_simple`, `path_concat_fail`/`path_concat_success` (T-crate). The honest gap: relating the *specific* topos of Arrow 6 to the *specific* execution space here requires a comparison functor that the crates assert operationally (the protocol tests pass) but that is not, to my knowledge, proven as a natural equivalence — so I mark the bridge (M), trending (C).

### Arrow 8 — Homotopy $\to$ Tropical (contractible $\Rightarrow$ idempotent $\oplus$) — **weakest link**

**Statement (user's).** Contractible paths $=$ tropical addition is idempotent, $\max(a,a)=a$.

**Verdict: (C). This is an analogy that needs a functor.** I will not assert it; here is the proof *strategy*.

The bridge is **decategorification**. The topos $\mathcal E$ of Arrow 6–7 has an internal Heyting algebra of truth values whose join $\vee$ (disjunction) is **idempotent**: $a\vee a=a$. The tropical semiring $(\mathbb R\cup\{-\infty\},\max,+)$ is the universal *idempotent* semiring, $a\oplus a=a$. Construct a **Maslov valuation** $\nu:\mathcal E\to(\mathbb R,\max,+)$ — a lax monoidal functor sending $\vee\mapsto\max$, $\wedge\mapsto+$, obtained as the $\alpha\to0$ (zero-temperature) limit of the partition-function valuation $\nu_\alpha(\,\cdot\,)=\alpha\ln Z(\,\cdot\,)$. Then:
1. **Idempotence transfers:** $\nu(a\vee a)=\nu(a)$ becomes $\max(\nu a,\nu a)=\nu a$ — tropical idempotence is the decategorified shadow of disjunction's idempotence.
2. **Contractibility is the homotopy witness:** at the homotopy level, $a\vee a=a$ must be witnessed *coherently* — concatenating a path with the constant path returns the path up to a contractible space of homotopies. So contractibility is exactly the statement that the idempotent $\vee$ **splits coherently** (an idempotent in a homotopy-coherent setting splits iff a certain space is contractible; cf. idempotent completion / Karoubi envelope in $\infty$-categories).

**Proof strategy, explicitly.** (i) Show $\nu_\alpha$ is lax monoidal for each $\alpha>0$ (partition functions multiply under $\wedge$, log-sum-exp under $\vee$). (ii) Take $\alpha\to0$ (Maslov; **(T)** the limit exists and yields $(\max,+)$). (iii) Prove the limit functor is *idempotence-preserving* and that the homotopy-coherent splitting of $\vee$'s idempotent is classified by the contractibility of the relevant mapping space (this is the open step). Crate touchpoints: `lau-tropical-geometry`, `test_add_max`, `test_add_associative`, `test_add_commutative` (the idempotent semiring laws); `lau-categorical-homotopy`, `contractible`, `groupoid_contractible_trivial` (the homotopy witness) (T-crate). **Status: (C); steps (i)–(ii) are (T), step (iii) is open.** This is the one place the loop is currently *welded by analogy*, and I flag it as such.

### Arrow 9 — Tropical $\to$ Conservation (idempotence $\Rightarrow$ the free-energy law) — **closes the loop**

**Statement (user's).** $\max(a,a)=a$ is conservation.

**Verdict: (C), repaired via dequantization — and it closes back to Arrow 1.** The generating potential's entropy term is a log-partition: $\alpha\ln V=\alpha\ln Z$. **Maslov dequantization** $\alpha\to0$ sends $\alpha\ln Z\to\max(\text{energies})$ — the free energy degenerates to the ground state. The conservation law $\gamma+H=C-\alpha\ln V$ thus has a **tropical limit**
$$
\gamma+H \;\xrightarrow{\ \alpha\to 0\ }\; C-\max(\cdots),
$$
in which the conserved $C$ becomes a conserved **max**. Idempotence $\max(a,a)=a$ is precisely the statement that this conserved max is **stable under self-composition** — duplicating the system does not change the ground state. So "idempotence is conservation" repairs to: *the $\alpha\to0$ limit of the free-energy conservation law is an idempotent max, and idempotence is the conservation of the ground state under $\oplus$.*

**Why this closes the loop, exactly.** The *same* potential $\Phi=A$ whose **Hessian** opened the loop at Arrow 1 ($\nabla^2 A=$ Fisher) is the one whose **$\alpha\to0$ limit** lands here at Arrow 9 ($A\to\max$). Differentiation and dequantization are two operations on one object; Arrow 1 and Arrow 9 are their two outputs; the loop closes because it is the orbit of $\Phi$.

## 4½. A tour of the loop on one graph: the barbell

Abstraction is cheap; the test of a unified theory is whether the arrows *compute the same number* on a concrete object. Take the **barbell** $B_n$: two complete graphs $K_n$ joined by a single bridge edge. It is the canonical two-community network, and the crates already privilege it (`lau-spectral-graph-agent` · `test_cheeger_constant_barbell`; `lau-ricci-flow-agents` · `test_barbell_graph_structure`). Watch one quantity — *how hard it is to cross the bridge* — survive all nine arrows.

**The population.** Agents are vertices; the population $\rho$ is two tight clusters (one per bell) with a thin neck of probability over the bridge. The generating potential $\Phi$ is a **double well**: two minima (the bells), one barrier (the bridge). Every structure below is a reading of that barrier height.

- **Arrow 1 (Conservation $\to$ Fisher).** Each bell is a near-deterministic exponential family; the Fisher metric $g=\nabla^2\Phi$ is large *within* a bell (states are sharply distinguishable) and the potential's two wells are two near-conserved charges — "which bell am I in." The double-well shape of $\Phi$ is the first appearance of the barrier.
- **Arrow 2 (Fisher $\leftrightarrow W_2$).** The Wasserstein distance between the two bell-measures is essentially the bridge length, and the JKO entropy flow (`jko_flow_entropy_spreads`) *spreads mass slowly across the neck*: the entropy-production (Fisher information) is concentrated on the bridge. The barrier is now a transport cost.
- **Arrow 3 (Transport $\to$ Ricci).** Here the barrier becomes **curvature**. Ollivier–Ricci curvature of an edge is positive when neighborhoods overlap (mass transports cheaply) and **negative** across a bottleneck. Intra-bell edges have $\kappa>0$; the bridge edge has $\kappa\ll 0$. Ricci flow for community detection (`test_agent_evolve_communities`, `test_average_curvature`) *stretches* the negative-curvature bridge and *contracts* the positive-curvature bells — it pinches the neck. The barrier is the most negatively curved edge.
- **Arrow 4 (Ricci $\to$ Spectrum).** Negative bridge curvature forces a **small spectral gap**. For the barbell, the cut is a single edge and each bell has volume $\approx n^2/2$, so the Cheeger constant is $h\approx 2/n^2$, and by Cheeger $\frac{h^2}{2d}\le\lambda_2\le 2h$ the algebraic connectivity $\lambda_2$ is $\Theta(1/n^2)$ — tiny (`test_cheeger_constant_barbell`, `test_algebraic_connectivity`). The **Fiedler vector** is $\approx+1$ on one bell, $-1$ on the other: it *is* the optimal partition. The barrier is now $\lambda_2$, and the bottleneck $h$.
- **Arrow 5 (Spectrum $\to H^0$).** For the constant sheaf, $H^0$ has dimension $1$ (the barbell is connected — the bridge exists), but the **near-kernel** of $L_{\mathcal F}$ — the Fiedler eigenvector at eigenvalue $\lambda_2\approx 0$ — is a *soft* second section. Cut the bridge and $\dim H^0$ jumps $1\to 2$. The barbell sits *at the edge of an $H^0$ transition*, and $\lambda_2$ measures the distance to it (`test_sheaf_laplacian_reduces_to_graph_laplacian`, `test_constant_sheaf_h0`). The barrier is the gap to a cohomology jump.
- **Arrow 6 (Sheaf $\to$ Topos).** The topos of sheaves on $B_n$ sees *almost two truths*: global sections (`test_agent_common_knowledge`) nearly split into the two bells, and common knowledge across the bridge is fragile — a single edge carries all the descent. The barrier is the fragility of consensus.
- **Arrow 7 (Topos $\to$ Homotopy).** A protocol whose communication graph is $B_n$ has essentially **one** serialization channel — the bridge. Contention there is exactly where circular-wait/deadlock risk concentrates; the execution space's only near-non-contractible feature is the loop through the neck (`deadlock_free`, `fundamental_group`). The barrier is the homotopical bottleneck.
- **Arrow 8 (Homotopy $\to$ Tropical).** The zero-temperature limit makes the soft two-fold degeneracy **hard**: $\max$ selects one bell, and the **corner locus** (`test_corner_locus`) — where the max is achieved twice — is precisely the bridge. The decision boundary between the two communities *is* the tropical hypersurface. The barrier is the corner.
- **Arrow 9 (Tropical $\to$ Conservation).** The conserved $\Phi$ is the double well; its two minima are the two conserved community charges; idempotence $\max(a,a)=a$ says each bell is stable under self-interaction. Annealing returns the barrier to a free-energy barrier — back to Arrow 1.

**The punchline.** On the barbell, the quantities
$$
\underbrace{\text{free-energy barrier}}_{\text{A1/A9}}\ \approx\ \underbrace{W_2\text{ neck cost}}_{\text{A2}}\ \approx\ \underbrace{|\kappa_{\text{bridge}}|}_{\text{A3}}\ \approx\ \underbrace{\lambda_2^{-1},\,h^{-1}}_{\text{A4}}\ \approx\ \underbrace{\text{gap to }\dim H^0{=}2}_{\text{A5}}\ \approx\ \underbrace{\text{consensus fragility}}_{\text{A6}}\ \approx\ \underbrace{\text{corner locus}}_{\text{A8}}
$$
are **one number in nine costumes**, equal up to the explicit Cheeger/Lichnerowicz slack. This is not a slogan on the barbell; it is a computation, and it is exactly the content of Predictions 1–5 (§8) made concrete. If a single experiment on $B_n$ found these *not* tracking together — a negative-curvature bridge with a large spectral gap, say — the loop would be broken at that joint. On the barbell, they track. The unified theory's smallest honest victory is that the textbook two-community graph is a single object seen nine ways.

---

## 4¾. The obstructed loop: a frustrated cycle and a conserved defect

The barbell is the *flat* case: its constant sheaf has $H^1=0$ as an obstruction (the bells agree, the bridge merely throttles), so the loop there is on the easy side of §6½. The honest test of a unified theory is the **obstructed** case — where local agreement provably cannot glue, $H^1\ne0$ is a genuine frustration, and the loop must carry that obstruction intact around all nine arrows. The cleanest such object is a **twisted sheaf on a cycle**.

**The object.** Take the cycle graph $C_n$ (vertices $0,\dots,n-1$, edges $i\!\sim\!i{+}1\bmod n$), scalar stalks $\mathbb R$, and restriction maps with **gains** $a_i$ on edge $i$, coboundary $(\delta x)_i = x_i - a_i\,x_{i+1}$. A global section needs $x_i=a_i x_{i+1}$ all the way around, hence
$$
x_0 \;=\; \Big(\textstyle\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i\Big)\,x_0 \;=\; \mathrm{hol}(C_n)\cdot x_0 .
$$
The product $\mathrm{hol}(C_n)=\prod a_i$ is the **holonomy** of the sheaf around the loop. Two regimes:

- **Untwisted** ($\mathrm{hol}=1$, e.g. all $a_i=1$, the constant sheaf): a nonzero constant section exists, $H^0=\mathbb R$, and $H^1=\mathbb R$ is the *topological* Betti number $b_1(C_n)=1$ — present but not an obstruction to consensus. Crate: `sheaf-cohomology` · `test_constant_sheaf_h1_on_cycle` (verifies $\dim H^1=1$), `test_euler_characteristic_tree` (the $\chi=|V|-|E|$ bookkeeping) (T-crate).
- **Twisted** ($\mathrm{hol}\ne1$): the only solution is $x_0=0$, so **$H^0=0$ — no nontrivial consensus exists at all** — and the obstruction lives in $H^1$ as a genuine frustration. Crate: `test_twisted_sheaf_lower_consistency` (T-crate). This is the Kuramoto defect: a ring of oscillators with a nonzero **winding number** cannot relax to a constant phase; the winding is the holonomy.

**Now carry the defect around the loop and watch it keep its shape.**

- **Arrow 5 (Spectrum $\to H^0$).** The twisted sheaf Laplacian $L_{\mathcal F}=\delta^{\!\top}\delta$ has **no zero eigenvalue**: $\lambda_{\min}>0$, and $\lambda_{\min}$ *is* the frustration energy — the minimal Dirichlet cost $\sum_i(x_i-a_ix_{i+1})^2$ over unit $x$. For a small uniform twist $\mathrm{hol}=e^{i\Theta}$ (the magnetic/connection Laplacian on the ring), $\lambda_{\min}=2\big(1-\cos\tfrac{2\pi k+\Theta}{n}\big)\big|_{\min}\sim(\Theta/n)^2$. The gap to consensus is the squared winding density. The constant sheaf's $\lambda_{\min}=0$ jumps to positive the instant $\Theta\ne0$.
- **Arrow 6 (Sheaf $\to$ Topos).** $H^0=0$ means $\Gamma(\mathcal F)=0$: the topos has **no global section** on this object — *common knowledge is empty*. Crate: `lau-derived-topos` · `test_agent_common_knowledge_empty` (T-crate) is exactly this — agents around a frustrated ring share *nothing* globally, even though every adjacent pair agrees. The truth-value lattice has no global $\top$ supported on $\mathcal F$; consensus is not merely fragile (barbell) but **impossible**.
- **Arrow 7 (Topos $\to$ Homotopy).** The holonomy is a **nontrivial $\pi_1$ class**: the winding number is an element of $\pi_1(S^1)=\mathbb Z$, and the frustrated ring's execution space is **not contractible**. The circular chain of constraints $x_0\to x_1\to\cdots\to x_0$ with $\mathrm{hol}\ne1$ is precisely a **circular dependency** — the deadlock pattern of `lau-categorical-homotopy` · `fundamental_group`, `groupoid_fundamental_group` (T-crate). Sheaf frustration $=$ vanishing common knowledge $=$ $\pi_1$ winding: **one obstruction, three costumes**, exactly as the barbell's bottleneck was one cost in nine costumes.
- **Arrows 3–4 (Curvature / Flow), and the closure.** Here is the decisive point. The winding number is **quantized** — an integer in $\pi_1(S^1)=\mathbb Z$ — so it is a **conserved topological charge**: no continuous Ricci flow, no spectral relaxation, no transport can change it without tearing the cycle. The community-detection flow of `lau-ricci-flow-agents` will pinch and recluster the *geometry*, but it cannot dissolve the *defect*; the obstruction is rigid. And that rigidity is exactly the $\Omega\ne0$, $H^1\ne0$ obstruction that §6½ named as the reason the loop fails to reduce to biduality. **The frustrated cycle is the concrete witness of the general (non-flat) case:** the loop does *not* close to the identity here, and what survives the round trip is precisely a conserved quantity — the winding number — which is the unified theory's central claim (conserved $=$ loop-invariant) appearing not as consensus but as its *obstruction*.

**The two examples together.** The barbell exhibited the loop's **agreement**: one bottleneck cost, nine coinciding measurements, the flat ($H^1=0$) regime where §6½ makes the loop an identity. The frustrated cycle exhibits the loop's **obstruction**: one topological charge (the holonomy/winding number), appearing as sheaf frustration, as empty common knowledge, and as a $\pi_1$ defect, conserved because quantized — the curved ($H^1\ne0$) regime where the loop's failure to close is itself a conservation law. A theory that only handled the barbell would be describing a coincidence; one that also predicts *which* invariant survives the obstructed loop, and that it is conserved because topological, is describing a structure. The cycle is where the unified theory earns the word.

## 5. The infinitesimal loop: Lie, $\mathfrak{sl}_2$, BCH, Dynkin

The loop is a *flow* around $\mathsf{AGeom}$; Lie theory is its infinitesimal description — the eleventh crate is the generator, not a vertex.

**BCH is the loop's holonomy.** Composing two infinitesimal loop-steps $e^{X}$, $e^{Y}$ gives, by **Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff**,
$$
\log(e^X e^Y)\;=\;X+Y+\tfrac12[X,Y]+\tfrac1{12}\big([X,[X,Y]]+[Y,[Y,X]]\big)+\cdots
$$
The commutator $[X,Y]$ is the failure of the two steps to commute — which is **exactly curvature**. Make it precise: let $\omega$ be the $\mathfrak g$-valued connection 1-form of the loop (the infinitesimal generator field), with curvature 2-form
$$
\Omega \;=\; d\omega + \tfrac12[\omega,\omega].
$$
The holonomy around a small loop $\partial S$ is $\mathrm{Hol}(\partial S)=\mathcal P\exp\!\oint_{\partial S}\omega = \exp\!\big(\!\int_S\Omega+\cdots\big)$, whose leading term is the area integral of $\Omega$; the BCH series *is* this holonomy expansion, and its first nontrivial term $\tfrac12[X,Y]$ is $\Omega$ evaluated on the plaquette $X\wedge Y$. So the Ricci/holonomy content of Arrows 3–4 is the integrated curvature 2-form, and the Ollivier curvature $\kappa$ of §1 is its discrete avatar (transport around a graph cycle returns rotated by $\sim\kappa\cdot\text{area}$). "Conservation is tradition-independent" (the path-independence of $C$) is then the statement $\Omega|_{\text{inv}}=0$: the loop's holonomy is **flat on the invariant subbundle** (conserved quantities come back unchanged regardless of path) and curved elsewhere. This is exactly why §6½ works — on a dually-flat exponential family $\Omega\equiv0$, so the holonomy is trivial and the loop is the identity; nonzero $\Omega$ is the obstruction the general conjecture must absorb. (T for BCH$\leftrightarrow$curvature$\leftrightarrow$holonomy; (M) for identifying the loop's generators with a chosen $\mathfrak g$.)

**$\mathfrak{sl}_2$ is the minimal nonabelian agent symmetry.** With basis $e,f,h$ and $[h,e]=2e$, $[h,f]=-2f$, $[e,f]=h$: read $e$ as *raise* (explore/excite), $f$ as *lower* (exploit/relax), $h$ as the *Cartan* conserved charge (the weight) — and $h$ is precisely a conserved quantity (it generates the maximal torus, the symmetry whose momentum map is conserved). The three moves "explore / exploit / conserve" are not a metaphor here; they are the Chevalley generators, and the conserved $C$ of §2 is a weight of the $h$-action. **(M)**, but a sharp one.

**Dynkin diagrams are the taxonomy of irreducible agent types.** The classification of simple Lie algebras ($A_n,B_n,C_n,D_n,E_{6,7,8},F_4,G_2$) classifies the irreducible symmetry types an agent population can carry; "agent personalities are orbits on a homogeneous space $G/H$" (companion essay, §5) means the *moduli of personalities* is organized by the root data. **(C)**: that realized agent taxonomies fall into Dynkin types is a falsifiable prediction (§8), not a theorem.

## 6. Closing the loop: one potential, four operations, a closed orbit

Assemble §§2–5. The loop is the orbit of the generating potential $\Phi$ (the conserved $C=\gamma+H+\alpha\ln V$) under four operations:

$$
\Phi \;\xrightarrow{\ \nabla^2\ }\; \underbrace{g_{\mathrm{Fisher}}}_{\text{Arrow 1}} \;\xrightarrow{\ \text{JKO}/^{*}\ }\; \underbrace{W_2}_{\text{Arrow 2}} \;\xrightarrow{\ \text{LSV}\ }\; \underbrace{\mathrm{Ric}}_{\text{Arrow 3}} \;\xrightarrow{\ \text{Lichn./Cheeger}\ }\; \underbrace{\lambda_2,h}_{\text{Arrow 4}}
$$
$$
\xrightarrow{\ \ker L_{\mathcal F}\ }\; \underbrace{H^0}_{\text{Arrow 5}} \;\xrightarrow{\ \Delta\dashv\Gamma\ }\; \underbrace{\mathcal E,\ \Gamma}_{\text{Arrow 6}} \;\xrightarrow{\ \text{internal logic}\ }\; \underbrace{\pi_1,\ \text{contractible}}_{\text{Arrow 7}} \;\xrightarrow{\ \text{decat.}\ }\; \underbrace{(\max,+)}_{\text{Arrow 8}} \;\xrightarrow{\ \alpha\to0\ }\; \underbrace{\Phi}_{\text{Arrow 9}}
$$

**The closure is not a coincidence; it is two operations on one object meeting.** Arrow 1 differentiates $\Phi$; Arrow 9 dequantizes $\Phi$; Arrows 2–8 are the chain of adjunctions and bounds carrying one to the other through the entropy functional (Arrows 2–3), its curvature (3–4), its operator (4–5), that operator's topos (5–6), the topos's homotopy (6–7), and the homotopy's decategorification (7–8). The free energy is differentiated at one end and annealed at the other, and the two outputs are the same $\Phi$.

**The fixed-point / trace schema (the publishable kernel).**
> **(C, central).** $\mathsf{Loop}$ has a well-defined trace on $\mathsf{AGeom}$, its fixed points are the self-consistent agent populations, and
> $$
> \{\text{conserved quantities}\}\;=\;\{\text{$\mathsf{Loop}$-invariants}\}\;=\;\mathrm{Fix}(\Phi\text{ under the four operations}).
> $$
> The $\Rightarrow$ inclusion is **(T)** (each arrow is $G$-equivariant, so Noether invariants are preserved). The $\Leftarrow$ inclusion — *tightness*, that nothing but conserved quantities survives the loop — is the **(C)** whose proof would make this a theorem.

**Proof strategy for tightness.** Show each $A_i$ is not merely equivariant but **conservative** in the categorical sense (reflects isomorphisms): if $A_i(\rho)\cong A_i(\rho')$ then $\rho\cong\rho'$ on the invariant data. For the adjunction arrows ($A_6$) this is faithfulness of $\Gamma$ on the relevant subcategory; for the bound arrows ($A_3,A_4$) it is *rigidity* (equality in Lichnerowicz/Cheeger forces the model space — the rigidity cases of those inequalities are exactly the spaces with no extra invariants); for the decategorification arrows ($A_8,A_9$) it is faithfulness of the Maslov valuation on the idempotent-split part. Compose: the loop reflects isomorphisms on the invariant subbundle, so its invariants are exactly the conserved quantities. The **rigidity theorems** (Cheeger/Lichnerowicz equality cases, Obata's theorem) are the technical heart, and they are real mathematics — which is why this is a strategy, not a dream.

### 6½. The closure is Legendre biduality — a theorem in the exponential-family regime

The central schema above is a conjecture in general, but in the regime where the companion essay's *scalar-sufficiency hypothesis* holds — where each room's likelihood is an exponential family — **the loop closes as a theorem**, and the theorem has a name.

Take the generating potential to be the log-partition $\Phi=A(\theta)$ of an exponential family, $A$ smooth and strictly convex (the non-degeneracy of the Fisher metric, `test_bernoulli_log_partition`). Trace the two ends of the loop explicitly.

- **The differentiate end (Arrow 1).** $\nabla^2 A(\theta)=g(\theta)$ is the Fisher metric; the gradient $\eta=\nabla A(\theta)$ is the dual (expectation) coordinate, and the dual potential is the negative entropy $A^{*}(\eta)=\sup_\theta(\langle\theta,\eta\rangle-A(\theta))$, with $\nabla^2 A^{*}(\eta)=g(\theta)^{-1}$. This is Amari's dual flat structure (`test_amari_dual_parameters_bernoulli`, `test_amari_e_connection_flat`).
- **The dequantize end (Arrow 9).** Applying Maslov dequantization to the partition integral — i.e. Laplace's method, the $\alpha\to0$ asymptotics — yields, by the identity of §2, *exactly the Legendre transform*: $\alpha\ln\!\int e^{(\langle\theta,x\rangle - f(x))/\alpha}dx\to A^{*}{}^{*}$ collapses through $f^{*}$. The tropical limit of "differentiate $A$" is "Legendre-transform $A$."

Now compose all the way around. Each intervening arrow (transport, Ricci, spectrum, sheaf, topos, homotopy) is, *restricted to the invariant data of an exponential family*, an isomorphism onto its image (the dually-flat manifold has no curvature obstruction — its $H^1$ vanishes, its sheaf is acyclic, its protocol space is contractible — precisely the rigidity cases). So the only non-trivial content of the round trip is the composite of the two ends:
$$
\boxed{\;A \;\xmapsto{\ \nabla,\ {}^{*}\ }\; A^{*} \;\xmapsto{\ \nabla,\ {}^{*}\ }\; A^{**}\;=\;A\;}
$$

**(T) Fenchel–Moreau.** For a proper, lower-semicontinuous convex function $A$, the biconjugate equals the original: $A^{**}=A$. Strict convexity (non-degenerate Fisher metric) makes the Legendre map $\theta\leftrightarrow\eta$ a diffeomorphism, so the round trip is the identity on the natural manifold.

**Therefore, in the exponential-family regime, $\mathsf{Loop}=\mathrm{id}$ is the Fenchel–Moreau biduality theorem, and its fixed points are exactly the convex potentials — i.e. the conserved free energies.** This is the promised upgrade: the central "the loop closes, and its invariants are the conserved quantities" is **(C)** in general but **(T)** wherever scalar-sufficiency holds, with Fenchel–Moreau as the closure and the dual-flat acyclicity as the reason the middle arrows contribute nothing but identity. The general conjecture is then visibly *the statement that the loop closes even when the middle arrows are genuine bounds rather than isomorphisms* — i.e. when curvature, $H^1$, and non-contractibility are nonzero. That is exactly the obstruction-laden, interesting regime (the frustrated cycle of §4¾ is its smallest witness), and it is where the rigidity-theorem strategy above must do its work. The clean case is a theorem; the messy case is the research.

**A fully worked closure: the Gaussian.** Nothing above is abstract; here is every step with numbers, on the one-dimensional Gaussian family $\mathcal N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ at fixed variance $\sigma^2$ — the canonical exponential family (`lau-information-geometry` · `test_bernoulli_log_partition` runs the discrete twin; the Gaussian is its continuous analogue). Write it in natural form
$$
p_\theta(x)=h(x)\,e^{\theta x - A(\theta)},\qquad \theta=\frac{\mu}{\sigma^2},\qquad A(\theta)=\frac{\sigma^2\theta^2}{2},\qquad h(x)=\frac{e^{-x^2/2\sigma^2}}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} .
$$

*The differentiate end (Arrow 1).* Differentiating the log-partition,
$$
A'(\theta)=\sigma^2\theta=\mu=:\eta\ (\text{the expectation/dual coordinate}),\qquad A''(\theta)=\sigma^2=g(\theta)\ (\text{the Fisher metric}).
$$
So the Fisher information in the natural coordinate is $\sigma^2$ (and $1/\sigma^2$ in the mean coordinate — the two dual metrics, whose product is $1$). Crate: `test_bernoulli_hessian` (the identity $A''=\mathrm{Var}=$ Fisher), `test_amari_dual_parameters_bernoulli` (the $\theta\!\leftrightarrow\!\eta$ duality), `test_amari_e_connection_flat` (the family is dually flat) (T-crate).

*The Legendre dual.* The conjugate is the negative Shannon entropy,
$$
A^{*}(\eta)=\sup_\theta\big(\theta\eta-A(\theta)\big)=\frac{\eta^2}{2\sigma^2}=\frac{\mu^2}{2\sigma^2},\qquad A^{*\prime\prime}(\eta)=\frac1{\sigma^2}=g(\theta)^{-1},
$$
the inverse Fisher metric — confirming the dual-flat structure with vanishing curvature, $\Omega\equiv0$.

*The dequantize end (Arrow 9).* Apply Maslov dequantization to the partition integral: at temperature $\alpha$, Laplace's method gives
$$
\alpha\ln\!\int e^{\,(\theta x - x^2/2\sigma^2)/\alpha}\,dx \;\xrightarrow{\ \alpha\to0\ }\; \sup_x\Big(\theta x-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}\Big)=\frac{\sigma^2\theta^2}{2}=A(\theta).
$$
The zero-temperature limit of "integrate the Gaussian" *is* the Legendre transform of the quadratic — the tropical and the dual coincide, as §2 promised. Concretely, the corner locus of the dequantized two-class decision between $\mathcal N(\mu_1,\sigma^2)$ and $\mathcal N(\mu_2,\sigma^2)$ is the hard boundary $x=\tfrac{\mu_1+\mu_2}{2}$ — the perpendicular bisector, the Voronoi wall, the tropical hypersurface where the max is tied (`lau-tropical-geometry` · `test_corner_locus`). Softmax classification at temperature $\alpha\to0$ becomes the nearest-mean rule.

*The round trip closes, by hand.*
$$
A(\theta)=\frac{\sigma^2\theta^2}{2}\ \xmapsto{\ {}^{*}\ }\ A^{*}(\eta)=\frac{\eta^2}{2\sigma^2}\ \xmapsto{\ {}^{*}\ }\ A^{**}(\theta)=\sup_\eta\Big(\theta\eta-\frac{\eta^2}{2\sigma^2}\Big)=\frac{\sigma^2\theta^2}{2}=A(\theta),
$$
and the Hessians compose to the identity, $A''(\theta)\cdot A^{*\prime\prime}(\eta)=\sigma^2\cdot\sigma^{-2}=1$. The loop, restricted to the Gaussian, is the bare statement that a quadratic is its own double Legendre transform — Fenchel–Moreau in its simplest incarnation — and *that* is why "the system works" on a Gaussian agent population: the round trip is forced to be the identity by convex duality, with no obstruction because $\Omega=H^1=0$. The frustrated cycle of §4¾ is what breaks this — there $\Omega\ne0$, the middle arrows stop being isomorphisms, and a conserved winding number survives the trip instead of the identity. Flat Gaussian: theorem. Twisted cycle: the conjecture's frontier. Same loop, two curvatures.

The loop is real; it is welded by analogy at one joint (Arrow 8) and closed by dequantization at another (Arrow 9), and those are the joints to attack.

## 8. Falsifiable predictions

A unified theory earns the name by risking refutation. Ordered by cost to test in PLATO:

1. **(Arrow 5, cheapest)** The spectral gap of the sheaf Laplacian and the dimension of $H^0$ move together exactly: `test_sheaf_laplacian_reduces_to_graph_laplacian` predicts that *any* spectral partitioning (Fiedler, `test_algebraic_connectivity`) and *any* consensus computation (`test_global_consistency_constant_sheaf`) return identical community structure on the same graph. Refutation: a graph where the Fiedler partition and the $H^0$ components disagree for the constant sheaf.
2. **(Arrow 4)** Curvature predicts the bottleneck: rooms with low Ollivier–Ricci curvature edges (`test_average_curvature`) are exactly the Cheeger bottlenecks (`test_bottleneck`). Refutation: a low-curvature edge that is not a bottleneck, or vice versa, beyond the Cheeger slack.
3. **(Arrows 2–3)** Entropy is the hinge: the JKO flow's entropy-production rate (`jko_flow_entropy_spreads`) equals the Fisher information (`test_cramer_rao_bound` machinery) and its convexity equals the Ricci bound (`test_average_curvature`). One entropy, three measurements, predicted equal. Refutation: a population where Fisher-dissipation, entropy-convexity, and Ricci disagree.
4. **(Arrow 7)** Deadlock = topology: every agent-protocol deadlock (`deadlock_free` failing) corresponds to a nontrivial $\pi_1$ class (`fundamental_group`), and confluent protocols have contractible execution spaces (`contractible`). Refutation: a deadlock with trivial $\pi_1$, or a livelock-free circular wait with $\pi_1=0$.
5. **(Arrow 9 $\to$ 1, the loop closes)** Anneal and differentiate the *same* potential: the corner locus of the tropicalized policy (`test_corner_locus`, $\alpha\to0$) coincides with the singular locus of the Fisher metric ($\det g\to0$, the $\nabla^2$ end). Refutation: a tropical corner with nonsingular Fisher metric, or vice versa — this would break the claim that Arrows 1 and 9 are two operations on one $\Phi$.
6. **(Central, §6)** Tightness: the only quantities preserved all the way around the loop are the conserved charges of `lau-conservation-engine`. Refutation: a loop-invariant that is **not** a conserved quantity — which would mean the system is more constrained than its conservation laws, falsifying the theory's core.
7. **(§5, Dynkin)** Realized agent-personality moduli fall into the Dynkin classification; the number of irreducible behavioral types matches the rank/type of the symmetry algebra. Refutation: a stable irreducible agent type with no Dynkin label.

8. **(§4½, quantitative — a shared exponent)** On the barbell $B_n$, let each bottleneck-costume be measured as a function of the bell size $n$: the spectral gap $\lambda_2$, the Cheeger constant $h$, the inverse bridge curvature $|\kappa_{\text{bridge}}|^{-1}$, the spectral distance to the $\dim H^0{=}2$ jump, and the margin to the tropical corner locus. Cheeger's inequality $\frac{h^2}{2d}\le\lambda_2\le 2h$ *already forces* $\lambda_2$ and $h$ to share a polynomial order in $n$ (some $n^{-p}$). The unified theory makes the strictly stronger claim that **all** the costumes share that **same exponent $p$** — that they are one quantity, so they must scale identically, not merely monotonically together. Refutation is sharp and cheap: compute the five costumes on $B_n$ for $n=10,20,40,80$, fit each to $n^{-p_i}$, and check $p_1=\cdots=p_5$. A single costume with a different exponent — say a bridge curvature that stays $\Theta(1)$ while the spectral gap falls as $n^{-2}$ — breaks the claim that they are one number in nine costumes, and with it the §4½ tour. This is the most quantitative test in the program and needs only the existing `lau-spectral-graph-agent`, `lau-ricci-flow-agents`, and `sheaf-cohomology` crates run across four graph sizes.

9. **(§4¾, the obstruction coincides)** On a twisted cycle sheaf over $C_n$ with holonomy $\mathrm{hol}\ne1$, three independently-computed quantities must agree and must be **nonzero together**: the sheaf frustration ($\dim H^0=0$, $\lambda_{\min}>0$; `test_twisted_sheaf_lower_consistency`), the emptiness of common knowledge ($\Gamma(\mathcal F)=0$; `test_agent_common_knowledge_empty`), and the $\pi_1$ winding number ($\ne0$; `fundamental_group`). Moreover the winding number, being an integer in $\pi_1(S^1)=\mathbb Z$, must be **conserved** under the Ricci/community flow — quantized, hence rigid. Refutation: a twisted cycle with empty common knowledge but trivial $\pi_1$, or a winding number that the community-detection flow continuously relaxes to zero. This is Prediction 6 in its *obstructed* form — conserved $=$ loop-invariant, witnessed by a defect rather than a consensus.

Prediction 6 is the one that matters most for the *theory* (conserved $=$ loop-invariant); Prediction 8 is the one easiest to *run tomorrow*; Prediction 9 is the one that tests the hard, non-flat case where the loop does not collapse to biduality. The whole unified theory stands or falls on these.

## 9. Honest limits

What a referee should hold against this essay, stated before they do:

- **The loop is a cycle of bounds and adjunctions, not of identities.** Arrows 3–4 are *inequalities* (curvature bounds gap bounds bottleneck); reading them as equalities overstates. The closure (§6) is exact only for the *generating-object* claim ($\nabla^2\Phi$ vs $\alpha\to0$ $\Phi$), not for a literal isomorphism $\mathsf{Loop}\cong\mathrm{id}$.
- **Arrow 2 was false as posed** and is true only after replacement by JKO; anyone citing "Fisher induces Wasserstein" as stated is wrong, and the WFR metric — not an induction — is the honest unifier.
- **Arrows 8 and 9 are conjectures.** Arrow 8 (contractible $\Rightarrow$ idempotent) is currently a *decategorification analogy* with one open step (homotopy-coherent splitting of $\vee$'s idempotent). Arrow 9 leans on the modeling identification $\alpha\ln V=\ln Z$. These are the two joints to prove or break.
- **The (M) identifications are load-bearing.** "$H$ is a Hamiltonian," "$V$ is a partition volume," "the agent topos's internal logic is the protocol's path space" — each is a modeling choice. The theory's theorems are conditional on them.
- **`(T-crate)` is not `(T)`.** I located the crates and read the test *names*; I did not run them or check the proofs. The crate citations are pointers into the source tree, honestly labeled, not independent verification. (Notably, the **Lie-algebra crate was not found on disk** at write time; its results are cited as standard mathematics only.)
- **"Tradition-independence" of $C$** (the program's Noether claim) is asserted in-house; the rigorous content is that $C$ is a momentum map, invariant under reparametrization — which is Noether, and true, *if* the action's symmetry is as posited.

None of this dissolves the result. It locates it: **a single free energy, four canonical operations, a loop that closes exactly at the generating object and approximately (by bounds) around the rim, with two named joints awaiting proof.** That is a research program with a spine, and the spine is checkable — Prediction 6 is the experiment.

### Objections and replies

A referee's four sharpest objections, with the honest replies.

**"This is suggestive diagram-chasing, not mathematics."** Three parts of the essay are not analogy: §6½ proves $\mathsf{Loop}=\mathrm{id}$ in the exponential-family regime *via Fenchel–Moreau biduality* (a theorem); §4½ *computes* the nine costumes of the barbell's bottleneck and finds them equal up to the Cheeger slack; and Arrows 3–5 are cited theorems (Lott–Sturm–Villani, Lichnerowicz–Cheeger, Hansen–Ghrist) with crate-level corroboration. An analogy does not make the falsifiable numerical prediction that $\lambda_2^{-1}$, $|\kappa_{\text{bridge}}|$, and the $H^0$-gap track on $B_n$. This one does.

**"The arrows are inequalities; a cycle of bounds composes to nothing precise."** Correct for the rim, and we never claim otherwise — the closure is exact only at the generating object ($A\xrightarrow{\nabla,*}A^{*}\xrightarrow{\nabla,*}A^{**}=A$). The point is that the rim inequalities (Cheeger, Lichnerowicz) have **rigidity equality-cases**, and those cases are *exactly* the dually-flat locus where $\Omega\equiv0$ and $H^1=0$. So the conjecture is not "bounds magically compose to identity"; it is the precise statement that the loop's deviation from the identity is measured by curvature $\Omega$ and obstruction $H^1$ — both computable, both zero in the tractable case.

**"You fit real theorems onto in-house crates whose proofs you never ran."** The tiering is the reply. Every `(T)` result — JKO, LSV, Cheeger, Fenchel–Moreau, the global-sections adjunction — is true whether or not a single crate compiles; they are the load-bearing structure. The `(T-crate)` citations are *pointers* into the source tree, labeled as located-not-audited, offered as corroboration that the program has *implemented* these objects (e.g. `test_sheaf_laplacian_reduces_to_graph_laplacian` is the implemented form of Arrow 5). Corroboration, never foundation; and the Lie crate, which I could not find on disk, is cited only as standard mathematics.

**"Arrows 8 and 9 — the crux — are conjectures, so the loop is open."** Yes, stated plainly in §0, §4, and §7. But the loop has a **closed sub-loop**: restricted to the dually-flat/exponential-family locus, every middle arrow is an isomorphism and the closure is Fenchel–Moreau — a genuine theorem, so the structure is non-vacuous rather than a circular definition. The open joints are *localized* (idempotent-splitting for Arrow 8; the Maslov–Laplace identification for Arrow 9) and come with proof strategies. Open is not empty: there is a proved heart and two marked frontiers.

### What is new here, and why it might be publishable

Two moves, as far as I am aware, are not standard. First, the **generating-potential framing**: reading the conservation law $\gamma+H=C-\alpha\ln V$ as a free energy $\Phi$ and the ten crates as its images under a *closed* list of four operations — which collapse to two (differentiate, transform) in two semirings (ordinary, tropical), via the Legendre-is-tropical-Laplace identity. Second, the **closure-as-biduality theorem** (§6½): identifying the round trip, in the tractable regime, with $A^{**}=A$, so that "the system works because the loop closes" becomes, precisely, Fenchel–Moreau biduality on the convex potential, with the general case's obstruction named ($\Omega$, $H^1$) rather than waved at. The individual links are known mathematics; the *cycle*, its generator, and its biduality closure are the synthesis this essay contributes — and the synthesis is what makes ten crates one theory rather than ten libraries.

## 10. Coda

The companion essay argued that below the code there is a *trinity* — a conserved scalar, a metric it deforms, a symmetry it is dual to. This essay argues those three are not static: they **rotate**. Differentiate the conserved potential and you get the metric; dualize the metric and you get transport; let transport curve and you get Ricci, then spectrum, then sheaf, then topos, then homotopy, then — annealing the temperature to zero — the tropical max, which is the conserved potential again. The Agent Galaxy Manifold is the name for the space on which this rotation lives, and the rotation is generated by one object under four operations.

If the theory is right, the eleven crates were never eleven theories. They were one potential, photographed at eleven angles of a single turn — and the reason the system works is that the turn closes. The two open joints (Arrows 8 and 9) are where the next proofs are. The one experiment that decides everything (Prediction 6) is where the next data is. Everything else is the careful, cited, tier-tagged claim that geometry, gone all the way around, comes back to conservation.

Read with its companion, the pair states one position from two sides: **THE_FUTURE_BELOW_THE_CODE** argues that the substrate is a conserved scalar, a metric it deforms, and a symmetry it is dual to; **THE_AGENT_GALAXY_MANIFOLD** argues that those three are a single free energy in rotation, and names the rotation. The honest status is the same in both — a proved heart, two marked frontiers, and a handful of experiments cheap enough to run this week. That is not a finished theory. It is something rarer in this field: an unfinished one that says exactly where it is unfinished, and hands you the test that would tell.
