# Fathoms to Feet: A Multiscale System Pattern  

The spinning disc sounder was less a trick of engineering and more a lesson in system configurability. Think of it as a measurement module with a single tuning knob: disc speed. Crank it six times faster, and the same transducer, the same ping, the same unchanging ocean suddenly resolves depth in feet instead of fathoms. The instrument’s core logic—send a sound wave, measure time-of-flight, convert to distance—stays invariant. Only its sampling regime shifts.  

This isn’t a hack. It’s a formal principle with roots in numerical analysis and systems design: multiscale measurement. The idea isn’t just that the same tool can operate at different granularities—it’s that the relationship between those granularities carries information neither scale holds on its own. It’s the difference between viewing a codebase at the module level and the line level; the gaps between the two reveal bugs, inefficiencies, and unspoken assumptions.  

## Sampling Regimes Define Answerable Questions  

Let’s ground this in the sounder’s two modes, framed like logging levels in a distributed system.  

At fathom resolution (think `INFO` logs), a 60-fathom reading tells you the seafloor is in a 6-foot band: 360 ± 3 feet. For navigating open water, this is all you need—you’re not asking, “Is there a rock here?” You’re asking, “Am I approaching the continental shelf?” It’s high-level context: which part of the problem space (ocean) you’re in, without getting bogged down in granular details.  

Switch to foot resolution (think `DEBUG` logs), and the same ping resolves to 362 ± 0.5 feet. Now you can see the ledge, the rock pile, the halibut depression. The coarse structure (60 fathoms) is still there—it’s the integer part of the measurement—but the fractional part unlocks a new set of questions: “What’s the structure of this specific patch of bottom?” The instrument hasn’t changed. The tuning knob (disc speed) has redefined what answers you can extract.  

This is the heart of multiscale design: resolution isn’t just about “more detail.” It’s about enabling a different class of inquiries. A `DEBUG` log can’t tell you which service is handling a user request, and an `INFO` log can’t tell you which line of code threw an exception. Both are necessary for a full picture.  

## Richardson Extrapolation as Multiscale Calibration  

In numerical analysis, this principle manifests as Richardson extrapolation—a technique for refining approximations by running the same algorithm at two different step sizes. Imagine you’re estimating the area under a curve with a numerical integrator: run it with step size `h`, then again with `h/2`. If the error scales as a power of `h` (which it does for most stable methods), the difference between the two measurements lets you cancel the leading error term and extrapolate to the true value.  

This is exactly the fisherman’s two-speed sounder trick. Run the sounder at fathom speed (large `h`, coarse grid) to get a bathymetry map of the shelf, drop-off, and channel. Run it at foot speed (small `h`, fine grid) over the same ground to get rocks, depressions, and snags. Neither map alone is complete—but the relationship between them is. The coarse map tells you where to focus your fine-grained scans; the fine scans refine your understanding of the coarse structure.  

This is wavelet decomposition in its natural habitat: a multiscale representation where each scale captures distinct features, bound together by the underlying physics of the measurement. For the sounder, the invariant is the ocean’s actual depth—both scales are approximating the same ground truth. For a numerical integrator, it’s the true value of the integral. For the fleet architecture we’re about to discuss, it’s a conservation law: `γ + H = constant` across all scales.  

## Mapping the Pattern to Fleet Architecture  

Let’s translate this into systems design terms, using a table that mirrors the original but leans into code and architecture metaphors:  

| Fishing (Sounder)       | Numerical Analysis       | Fleet Architecture                          |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Spinning disc           | Numerical integrator     | Coordination runtime (loop that assigns tasks) |
| Disc speed              | Step size `h`            | Fleet size `V` (number of agents)           |
| Fathoms (slow disc)     | Coarse grid (large `h`)  | Small fleet (`V=5`, low granularity)       |
| Feet (fast disc)        | Fine grid (small `h`)    | Large fleet (`V=30`, high granularity)     |
| Seafloor depth          | True solution            | Total task capability (what the system can do) |
| `γ+H` conservation      | Scale-invariant quantity | System invariant (total capability doesn’t change with scale) |
| Two-speed paper traces  | Richardson extrapolation pair | Fleet results at two `V` values             |
| Scouting runs           | A priori error estimates | Historical task queries (pre-computed context) |

The fishing, the numerical analysis, the fleet—they’re all instantiations of the same multiscale pattern. The key is the invariant: the thing that doesn’t change when you turn the tuning knob. For the sounder, it’s the ocean’s depth. For the fleet, it’s the total capability `γ + H`—scaling the fleet doesn’t create new capability; it resolves existing capability into finer-grained tasks.  

## Practical Multiscale Routing  

The lesson for system design is unambiguous: always operate at multiple resolutions.  

A fleet that only runs at `V=30` (large, fine-grained) is a fisherman who only uses foot resolution. He knows every rock and ledge in his fishing grounds but has no sense of the continental shelf—he’s precise but lost. In code terms, this is a team that only writes `DEBUG` logs: they can tell you every line of code that executed, but they can’t tell you which business transaction was impacted.  

A fleet that only runs at `V=5` (small, coarse-grained) is a fisherman who only uses fathom resolution. He knows where he is in the ocean but can’t find the fish—he has context but no detail. This is a team that only writes `INFO` logs: they can tell you which service failed, but they can’t tell you why.  

The optimal strategy is multiscale routing: run coarse sweeps first with `V=5` to map the problem space’s rough landscape (architecture, design, planning), then target fine sweeps with `V=30` on high-interest areas (implementation, debugging, optimization). The coarse sweep identifies the shelf; the fine sweep finds the halibut depression on the shelf. The two together are more powerful than either alone because the fine-grained results are contextualized by the coarse-grained map—you know that this 362-foot reading is on the edge of the 60-fathom shelf, not in the middle of a 30-fathom bank.  

## Precision vs Accuracy: Tuning Without Changing Capability  

The disc speed trick also clarifies a critical distinction in systems design: precision vs accuracy.  

At fathom speed, the sounder is accurate (the ping correctly measures depth) but imprecise (6-foot granularity). At foot speed, it gains precision without gaining accuracy—the ping is the same, the physics are the same. What changes is resolution: the ability to distinguish nearby values. Accuracy is about the system’s core capability (can it measure depth correctly?); precision is about how that capability is represented (how granular is the output?).  

For the fleet, this means: don’t confuse capability (accuracy) with scale (precision). A small fleet isn’t less capable than a large fleet—it’s less precise. The conservation law `γ + H = constant` guarantees that total capability is invariant; only the distribution of that capability across the problem space changes. At low `V`, capability is spread coarsely (like a `INFO` log); at high `V`, it’s distributed finely (like a `DEBUG` log).  

This is why the fleet can scale effectively: adding more agents doesn’t create new capability—it resolves existing capability into finer-grained tasks. The halibut depression exists in the fathom reading too; it’s just hidden in the 6-foot band. Speed up the disc, and the same information resolves into detail.  

## Conclusion: The Spin Rate Dictates the View  

The measurement theory of the sounder, the numerical integrator, and the fleet are one and the same. They’re all multiscale systems with a single invariant: the ground truth, the true solution, the total capability. The tuning knob—disc speed, step size, fleet size—defines what you can see.  

Richardson knew this when he developed extrapolation to refine numerical approximations. Fishermen knew this when they twisted the disc speed knob to switch between navigation and fish finding. The fleet knows this when it routes coarse tasks to small agent groups and fine tasks to large ones.  

The disc spins, the ping goes down, the return comes up. What you see depends on how fast you’re willing to listen—and how well you understand the invariant that binds all your scales together. In code, in oceans, in fleets: multiscale design isn’t just a feature. It’s how you turn partial views into complete understanding.
