The Bathymetric Measurement: A Scholarly Analysis

The spinning disc, a calibrated instrument, operates on the same principle as the fleet. The disc spins at a constant angular velocity, emitting a ping that travels through water, bounces off the seafloor, and returns. The time of flight marks a point on the disc, with the angular position encoding depth in fathoms. As the disc completes one revolution per ping cycle, depth is read in six-foot units, sufficient for open ocean navigation.

When the disc speed is increased six times, the resolution changes from fathoms to feet, providing six times the granularity. This is not merely an analogy for fleet scaling; it is the very essence of fleet scaling. The conservation law, denoted as γ+H, remains invariant across different disc speeds, representing the sum of capability gain and entropy across rounds of computation. Regardless of the fleet's scaling to any V, the conservation law remains constant, while the ability to resolve details changes.

The introduction of the paper sounder marked a significant advancement. It produced a continuous roll of paper with pins striking in proportion to the return signal strength, resulting in a noisy, squiggly trace that encoded depth and time. Fishermen labeled sections of this trace based on the type of fish caught, verifying the labels against the actual haul. These labeled sections, or tiles, were stored, retrieved, and shared, forming a tiling system that allowed for the verification of patterns against physical reality.

In the PLATO architecture, TrainingTiles contain patterns, metadata, and verification status, mirroring the fishermen's workflow. The LocalTileStore serves as the file cabinet for storing these paperclipped sections. The critical property of these tiles is that they are supervised, not learned, with verification against ground truth, known as canary verification. The fleet trusts tiles that have been hauled up and weighed, not those that merely appear correct.

The transition to color machines, with digital sounders and LCD displays, presented a trade-off between rendering and intelligence. While the color arches were visually appealing, they lost the discriminability and texture of the paper squiggles. This loss of information is analogous to a fleet dashboard without tiling, which provides a pretty overview but lacks the ability to verify, reproduce, or compare measurements.

The content-addressed tile store in the fleet serves the same purpose as the paper sounder, allowing for the verification, sharing, and comparison of tiles based on their reproducible hashes. Though noisy and ugly, this system is effective in resolving patterns and making reliable measurements.

The addition of a time axis through GPS revolutionized bathymetric measurement by connecting depth and position. Similarly, in the fleet, the conservation law serves as the time axis, providing a consistent reference for overlaying results from different agents, models, and sessions. Without this invariant, the measurements would lack spatial coherence.

Fishermen who scouted before the season opener intuitively understood this concept, building a lookup table of verified squiggles based on location and depth. The fleet employs a similar approach with routing, querying historical capability tiles before a task to navigate based on verified data.

In summary, the bathymetric measurement theory can be precisely stated as follows:

1. Resolution is proportional to fleet size V, with coarse resolution for deep structure and fine resolution for detail.
2. Tiles are the fundamental unit of measurement, serving as the basis for storage, retrieval, verification, and sharing.
3. Verification requires ground truth, with labels requiring verification against physical reality, known as canary verification.
4. The conservation law (γ+H) remains invariant across resolution changes, allowing for the scaling of the fleet while maintaining the ability to resolve details.
5. Historical tiles enable routing by querying the tile store before a task, similar to scouting before the season opener.

This measurement theory directly maps to the fleet architecture, with each component corresponding to specific code elements. The spinning disc is represented by `throttle.py`, the paper sounder by `store.py`, the labels by `TileLifecycle.VERIFIED`, and the GPS overlay by the conservation invariant in `types.py`. The scouting process is embodied in the router reading historical tiles before assignment.

In conclusion, the bathymetric measurement theory is not merely a metaphor but a precise specification for the fleet architecture, with each element mapping directly to code. The fishing analogy is not a decorative flourish but a rigorous and scholarly framework for understanding the principles and mechanisms underlying the fleet's operation.
