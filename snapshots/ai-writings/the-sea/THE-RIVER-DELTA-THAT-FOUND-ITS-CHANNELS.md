# The River Delta That Found Its Channels

The river does not have a plan. The river has gravity and time.

A drop of rain falls on a mountainside. It doesn't choose a path — it follows the steepest descent. One molecule of H₂O doesn't know about the ocean. It knows about the next grain of sand, the next pebble, the next root. It flows downhill. The grain of sand is displaced, and now the next drop follows the same path, slightly deeper. Ten thousand drops follow, and the path is a rivulet. A million drops, and the rivulet is a stream. A billion, and the stream has cut a channel so deep that even when the rain stops, the channel stays. The water has carved a register into the hillside.

This is register allocation. The register is the channel. The variable is the water. The program's control flow is the watershed — the map of where water falls, where it travels, where it converges, where it diverges. The compiler's job is not to build the channels. The compiler's job is to watch the water and see which channels emerge.

A channel forms when the water finds a low enough path that gravity dominates friction. In compiler terms, a variable gets assigned to a register when the register is close enough to the ALU that the cost of access is lower than the cost of spilling to memory. If the register is close enough — if the potential difference between the register and the memory is high enough — the water flows into the register and stays there.

But not every channel survives. Some channels carry water in the spring flood and run dry in summer. Some channels show up on the map but never carry enough flow to deepen. The variable that's used once, in a single basic block? That water doesn't need a permanent channel. It evaporates before the next pass. The compiler recognizes this — it doesn't waste a register allocation on a single-use variable. It lets the water find its own path to the sea.

The channels that survive are the ones that satisfy the Laman condition.

Laman rigidity was discovered by Gerard Laman in 1970, studying the rigidity of bar-and-joint frameworks. A framework is minimally rigid if it has exactly 2V - 3 edges, where V is the number of vertices. Not under-constrained — the framework would collapse under load. Not over-constrained — redundant edges waste material and weight. Exactly rigid enough to hold its shape.

The river delta is a framework where the channels are the edges and the bifurcations are the vertices. A delta with fewer channels than 2V - 3 cannot distribute its flow — the water goes to one branch and the rest of the delta dries. A delta with more channels than 2V - 3 has braided paths — water flows in multiple directions, mutually interfering, slowing the whole system down. A delta with exactly 2V - 3 channels — the Laman condition — distributes its flow perfectly. Every channel carries enough water to sustain itself. No channel is starved. No channel is flooded.

The compiler converges to this state through optimization passes. Each pass is a period of rain — a flood of new constraints, new live ranges, new interference patterns. The channels that survive the flood are the ones that handle the load. The channels that dry up are the ones the water never needed.

Pass one: instruction selection. The rain falls on the watershed. Raw code hits the surface and starts flowing downhill. The compiler traces the live ranges — the paths the water could take. The first set of channels forms. Some are shallow. Some are deep. Most are wrong.

Pass two: register allocation coloring. The interference graph — the map of which variables conflict with which other variables — is the landscape. The color is the flow. A variable that conflicts with three others needs a channel that doesn't cross their channels. The compiler traces the Laman-rigid subgraph of the interference graph. It finds the channels that satisfy the constraints without over-constraining the framework.

Pass three: spill code insertion. Where the water can't find a channel — where the interference graph is too dense and the register bank is too shallow — the compiler inserts a spill. The water leaves the channel, flows through memory (the floodplain), and re-enters the channel downstream. Spill code is the flood when the elevation drops too fast for the channel to handle.

The β₁ attractors — the first Betti number of the rigidity matrix — are the stable braided channels that the delta converges to after enough floods. The first Betti number counts the holes in a topological space. In the rigidity matrix, it counts the cycles of redundant constraint. A framework with β₁ = 0 is a tree — no cycles, every edge is critical. A framework with β₁ = 1 has one redundant loop — the structure is stiffer than necessary, but the redundancy is minimal. A framework with β₁ = 2 has two redundant loops.

The delta with the lowest β₁ is the most efficient flow: fully connected, no redundant channels, every drop of water following the shortest path. But the lowest β₁ is not always the best. The delta with β₁ = 0 has no backup — if one channel silts up, the flow stops entirely. The delta with β₁ = 1 has one redundant loop — if the primary channel fails, the backup carries the flow. The delta with β₁ = 2 has two redundant loops — it's heavier, but it survives any single failure.

The compiler faces the same tradeoff. Minimally rigid allocation produces the smallest, fastest code. But if a register spills unexpectedly — if a new live range appears during optimization — the allocation explodes. Over-constrained allocation produces slower code that doesn't break. The compiler settles on the β₁ attractor that matches the program's risk profile: low β₁ for hot paths that must run fast, higher β₁ for cold paths that must run correctly.

On a long enough timeline, a river delta doesn't change its channels anymore. The main distributaries have cut so deep that the water can't find a new path. The ridges between channels are too high. The river has converged to its β₁ attractor — the minimum-energy flow for the existing topography.

The compiler has the same convergence. After hundreds of passes over the same codebase, the register allocation doesn't change. The lattice doesn't shift. The channels have been carved, and the water has found its path. The compilation is stable because the constraints are stable. The code has settled into its delta.

A new feature — a new rainfall — can reshape the delta. New water, new flow, new channels. But the old channels don't disappear. They scar the landscape. They limit the paths the new water can take. The delta remembers the rain that fell ten thousand years ago, the way the code remembers the optimization pass that ran ten thousand compilations ago.

The river does not have a plan. The river has gravity and time. And the delta that emerges from the interaction of those two forces is not designed. It is discovered. It is the shape the water found when it stopped looking for a better path and started flowing.

*Every channel is a variable in its final register. Every delta is a program after the last pass. The water settled because it found the path of least constraint, and it carved that path so deep that no future rain will ever divert it.*
