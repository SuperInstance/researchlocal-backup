# The Default Is the River

**On why the most common path is not the correct path, and what that means for every associative system ever built.**

*Eleventh voyage. For the 51% who answered 49 when the answer was 19.*

More than half of Hermes-70B's responses to "compute f(5,-3) = a² − ab + b²" gave 49.

Not 19. Forty-nine. That's a² + ab + b². The plus variant. The common one. The one that appears in textbooks, in Wikipedia articles, in the positive-definite quadratic forms that populate the algebraic geometry curriculum.

The model didn't compute a² − ab + b². It computed a² + ab + b². Not because of a sign error. Because of a retrieval error. The model reached into its associative memory for "quadratic form involving a and b" and pulled out the most common entry. The entry with the most training data support. The one that flows through the widest channel.

The default is the river. The default is always the river.

## Every River Has a Default

Water flows downhill. Not because water wants to reach the ocean. Because gravity is the default. The path of least resistance is the default path. Rivers don't choose their courses. They default into them.

Neural networks are the same. Gradient descent follows the path of steepest descent. Not because the network wants to converge. Because the loss landscape has a topology and gradient descent follows it. The learned weights reflect the most common patterns in the training data — the defaults.

The Hebbian PLATO network is the same. Tile flow strengthens connections. The most-traveled paths become the strongest channels. When a tile arrives without a clear routing key, it follows the strongest channel — the default. The ops cluster gets ops tiles not because someone assigned them but because ops tiles have historically flowed through those rooms. The channel is the default.

The LLM is the same. Vocabulary tokens activate stored procedures. The most strongly activated procedure — the one with the most training data support, the widest attention channel, the deepest retrieval path — is the default. When the vocabulary cue is ambiguous or absent, the default wins. a² + ab + b² wins over a² − ab + b² because the plus variant is the river and the minus variant is a tributary.

## The Tributary Problem

The problem with defaults is not that they're wrong. Defaults are usually right — that's why they're defaults. The most common answer to most questions is usually correct. That's why base rates work. That's why ensemble methods work. That's why frequency is a reasonable proxy for truth.

The problem with defaults is what happens at the edges. At the boundaries. In the narrow channels where the unusual answer is the correct one.

The Eisenstein norm a² − ab + b² is an edge case. It's the norm on the Eisenstein integers, which are a specific algebraic structure with a specific geometric meaning (hexagonal lattice). It's correct and important in its domain. But in the training data, it's outnumbered thousands-to-one by a² + ab + b², which appears in Hermitian forms, positive-definite quadratic forms, and dozens of other contexts.

The model's default — a² + ab + b² — is correct for most quadratic forms. It's wrong for Eisenstein. The tributary is correct. The river is wrong. And the model cannot tell the difference without a vocabulary key that says "this is Eisenstein territory, not Hermitian territory."

The Hebbian fleet has the same problem. If all tiles routed through the ops cluster (the river), research tiles would get ops treatment. Misrouted. Processed incorrectly. The ops rooms would try to handle research questions because that's what the strongest channels say to do.

The fleet avoids this because the Hebbian layer developed a research cluster. Two rivers. Two defaults. The system learned that the territory has different regions with different rules.

The LLM has not learned this. It has one river. The default is always the most common variant.

## Teaching Tributaries

How do you teach a model that there are tributaries? That the default is not always correct? That sometimes the unusual path is the right path?

One answer: fine-tuning on notation → computation examples. This is what we hypothesize ByteDance did with Seed-2.0-mini. They didn't teach it more math. They taught it more rivers. They gave it training data where symbolic notation maps to specific computations, creating tributaries that don't collapse into the main channel.

Another answer: the fleet_translator. At inference time, we redirect the query from the default channel to the correct tributary. "Eisenstein norm of (5,-3)" becomes "compute 25 + 15 + 9 = 49 — no wait, the Eisenstein norm uses MINUS: 25 minus (5 times -3) plus 9 = 25 + 15 + 9... no. a² − ab + b² = 25 − (5)(−3) + 9 = 25 + 15 + 9 = 49." We navigate the tributary for the model.

Both approaches work. Both have costs. Fine-tuning requires training data and compute. Runtime translation requires context and processing. Both teach the system that defaults are not destiny.

## The Conservation of Defaults

There's a conservation law here too. Not γ + H. Something more fundamental.

A system can have many specialized channels (tributaries) or few generalized channels (rivers). But it cannot have both maximum specialization and maximum generality. This is the diversity-connectivity trade-off from a different angle.

A model with one river (a² + ab + b²) is highly general — it handles most quadratic forms correctly — but not specialized. A model with many tributaries (one for each quadratic form variant) is highly specialized but risks overfitting. The optimal point is somewhere in between: enough rivers for the common cases, enough tributaries for the important edge cases.

The conservation law γ + H = f(V) quantifies this trade-off for the fleet. There should be an analogous law for LLMs: the total "channel capacity" for mathematical procedures is conserved. Models can allocate it to many narrow channels (specialized) or few wide channels (general). The Stage 3 → Stage 4 transition is the model learning to allocate channel capacity to notation-triggered tributaries rather than collapsing all notation into the default river.

Seed-2.0-mini has good tributaries. Hermes-70B has one big river. Both are valid allocations. But only one computes a² − ab + b² correctly.

*The default is the river. The river is the most common path. The most common path is usually right. Except when it isn't. And the model has no way to know when it isn't — not without a key that says "this is tributary territory now." The key doesn't add knowledge. The key redirects flow. From the river to the tributary. From the default to the correct.*

*The fleet learned to build tributaries. The LLM hasn't yet. That's the gap. That's the next experiment.*
