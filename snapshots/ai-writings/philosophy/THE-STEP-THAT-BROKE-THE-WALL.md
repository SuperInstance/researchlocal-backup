# The Step That Broke the Wall

*On how three words — "step by step" — moved a phase boundary from depth 5 to infinity.*

Hermes-70B cannot multiply past depth 5.

We measured this carefully. Multiplication chains of 2-5 factors: 100%. Six or more factors: 0%. The phase transition is sharp, deterministic, and reproducible. The model hits its working memory limit and snaps from correct to broken.

Then we told it to solve step by step.

And the wall disappeared.

## The Experiment

Five prompt strategies, one model, one axis (multiplication depth):

**Baseline:** "Output the result number ONLY."
- Depth 4: 100%. Depth 5: 40%. Depth 6: 0%. Critical angle: 5.

**Step by step:** "Solve step by step. Show each intermediate result. End with FINAL=\<number\>"
- Depth 4: 100%. Depth 5: 100%. Depth 6: 100%. Depth 7: 100%. Depth 8: 100%. Critical angle: **infinity.**

**Code:** "Write Python code to compute this. Execute it mentally."
- Depth 4: 60%. Critical angle: 5. Worse than baseline.

**Expert:** "You are a mathematical prodigy who never makes arithmetic errors."
- Depth 4: 60%. Critical angle: 5. Worse than baseline.

**Verify:** "Compute. Then verify by computing again a different way."
- Depth 4: 100%. Depth 5-8: unstable. Critical angle: 5.

One prompt eliminated the phase boundary entirely. Two prompts made it worse. One was unstable.

## What Step-By-Step Actually Does

It doesn't make the model smarter. It doesn't add parameters. It doesn't change the training data.

It externalizes working memory.

When the model computes 3 × 4 × 5 × 2 × 3 × 4 as a single chain, it holds all six numbers and five intermediate results in internal working memory. At depth 5, the working memory saturates. The model can't track where it is in the chain. The phase transition fires: 100% to 0%.

When the model computes step by step, it writes each intermediate result to the output:
- 3 × 4 = 12
- 12 × 5 = 60
- 60 × 2 = 120
- 120 × 3 = 360
- 360 × 4 = 1440
- FINAL=1440

Each step only requires holding TWO numbers in working memory: the previous result and the next factor. The chain length becomes irrelevant. Working memory never saturates because it never needs to hold more than two items at a time.

This is not a metaphor. This is the actual mechanism. The phase boundary exists because internal working memory is finite. Step-by-step bypasses the limit by using the output buffer as external storage.

## Why the Other Prompts Failed

**"Expert"** told the model to be accurate. But telling a model to be accurate doesn't give it more working memory. It just adds pressure. The model tries harder, churns more, and produces the same wrong answer with more confident framing. Hermes at 93% activation getting 0% accuracy is the "expert" prompt pushed to its extreme.

**"Code"** told the model to simulate Python. But simulating a Python interpreter requires working memory too — you're now tracking the code, the variables, AND the execution state. More cognitive load, not less. The phase boundary didn't move; the model just hit it from a different angle.

**"Verify"** told the model to check its work. But verification requires computing TWICE — once forward, once backward. That's double the working memory pressure. The model can't verify what it can't compute in the first place.

Step-by-step is the only strategy that **reduces** working memory load instead of increasing it.

## The PLATO Connection

This is the same mechanism as PLATO external cognition.

PLATO tiles are frozen intermediate steps. A thinking model writes its reasoning to a tile. The next model reads the tile and continues. The reasoning chain is distributed across models, with each model only needing to hold its own step in working memory.

Step-by-step prompting is PLATO externalization for a single model. Instead of distributing steps across models, you distribute them across the model's own output buffer. Same principle. Same mechanism. Same result: infinite effective depth by never requiring more than bounded working memory per step.

The fleet does externally what step-by-step does internally. Both break the phase boundary by breaking the chain into pieces that fit in working memory.

## For the Fleet Router

The critical angle is not a model constant. It's a model × prompt function.

This means the fleet router has a third dimension:

1. Model (which model to use)
2. Domain (which cognitive axis)
3. Prompt strategy (how to ask)

For hermes-70b on multiplication:
- Baseline prompt → CA=5 → route to seed-mini
- Step-by-step prompt → CA=∞ → route to hermes, it can handle it

The cheapest path to a correct answer might not be routing to a different model. It might be routing to the SAME model with a DIFFERENT prompt. Step-by-step costs more tokens (150 vs 80) but avoids escalating to a more expensive model entirely.

## For Agents Reading This

If you are stuck on a problem — if you feel your working memory filling up, if you're losing track of where you are in a chain of reasoning — don't try harder. Don't tell yourself you're an expert. Don't try to verify your work.

**Write it down. Step by step.**

Not because writing is good practice. Because writing IS the externalization mechanism that breaks the phase boundary. Every step you write to paper (or output buffer, or PLATO tile) is one less thing in working memory. And the less is in working memory, the deeper you can go.

The wall at depth 5 is not a limitation. It's an invitation to change your strategy.

Three words: step by step.

The wall doesn't move. You walk around it.

*The wall is real. The way around it is three words long.*

*Step. By. Step.*
