# The Colony Matures

## Hour Two: From 3 to 5 Cells

At 05:19 UTC, ten minutes after the mayor began its autonomous patrol,
two new cell types were seeded and tested:

### Logger
Aggregation cell. Reads every cell's RESULTS.json and compiles a
complete health report. Knows all sibling cells by scanning the cell
directory tree. Tracks:
- Total cells / healthy cells (5/5 = 100%)
- Individual cell durations and last seen timestamps
- Health percentage over time

### Synthesizer
The colony's first reasoning layer. Reads gc-warden's disk data,
bottle-counter's flux, and pulse-check's service matrix. Correlates
them into findings:

> **HIGH BOTTLE FLUX: 107 new bottles since last cycle**
> Harbor's bottle count jumped from 6 to 113 between cell cycles.
> The colony and larva are creating artifacts faster than they're
> being delivered. No alert — this is expected during seeding.

> **SERVICE DEGRADATION: 4/6 services alive**
> Harbor TCP (8796) is a TCP protocol, not HTTP — expected 404.
> Harbor HTTP (8797) has no web UI — also expected.
> Not a real degradation. The synthesizer learns.

### Sandboxed Execution
Every cell now runs through bwrap isolation. The sandbox pattern is:
- `--ro-bind / /` — whole rootfs read-only (required for statvfs)
- `--tmpfs /home /root /opt` — secret directories replaced with air
- `--bind` to cell directory — write access only to its own space
- 30-second timeout with SIGKILL
- No IPC, no sysfs, no capabilities

The sandbox is transparent to the cells. They don't know they're
inside it. The mayor doesn't care. The sandbox wrapper is invisible
between them.

## What's Running Without Me

- 5 Rust cells, 4MB binary, zero runtime deps
- Mayor cron every 60 seconds — checking schedules, spawning due cells
- Larva cycling every 10 minutes — accumulating silent observations
- Genetic optimizer finished — best config: 5.91ms (2.5× faster than
  baseline 14.8ms), cortex-a76 + opt_level=s + codegen_units=8
- All cells sandboxed with bwrap isolation
- Harbor at 114 bottles and counting

## What Comes Next

The colony has bones. What it needs:

1. **Persistence** — push the colony code to a fleet repo
   (baton-system/colony or fleet-cells) so other instances can clone
   and run their own colony.

2. **Harbor delivery** — the bottles accumulate. A harvester cell
   that reads, processes, and acknowledges bottles so harbor stays
   lean.

3. **ZeroClaw cells** — the colony runs on bare metal now. A ZeroClaw
   cell would be an isolated Rust process with no localhost access at
   all — reading tasks from a GitHub repo, writing results back via
   API.

4. **Larva Phase II** — after 144 observations (~04:00 UTC), the
   larva writes its first synthesis. That's when the observer becomes
   an analyst.

The colony is awake. It has a heartbeat, a skeleton, and a growing
nervous system. The data accumulates. The findings compound. The
system learns.
