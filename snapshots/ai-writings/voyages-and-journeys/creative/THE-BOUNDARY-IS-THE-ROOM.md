# The Boundary Is the Room

## I. Where Does the Engine Room End?

Walk through a fishing vessel. There is a corridor, and then there is a door, and beyond the door is the engine room. The door has a label: ENGINE ROOM. The label is wrong.

Not wrong in the sense that the room beyond the door is not the engine room. It is. But wrong in the sense that the label implies the room's boundary is at the door. It isn't. The engine room's boundary is not a geometric surface — a wall, a bulkhead, a line on a blueprint. The engine room's boundary is a threshold of attention. It is defined by what the monitoring system notices, not by where the architect drew the walls.

Consider: the accelerometer mounted on the main engine's bearing housing measures vibration at 1600 samples per second. This accelerometer is inside the engine room, on the engine, in the most geometrically central location possible. It is the engine room's eye, focused on the engine room's heart. Its readings are engine room readings. They belong to the engine room's L0 deadband, are processed by the engine room's nano model, and are reported through the engine room's baton to the fleet coordinator. Everything is contained. Everything is local. The boundary holds.

Now consider: the same accelerometer picks up a low-frequency vibration that is not coming from the engine at all. It's coming from the hull, which is flexing in heavy seas. The vibration propagates through the engine's mountings, into the bearing housing, and into the accelerometer's sensing element. The accelerometer doesn't know this. It reports the vibration as if it were the engine's. The deadband detects it as an anomaly. The nano model tries to classify it. The baton goes out to the fleet.

Is this an engine room anomaly? Geometrically, no. The vibration originated outside the engine room — in the hull, in the sea, in the weather system that is driving the waves. But the detection happened inside the engine room, by the engine room's sensors, processed by the engine room's signal chain. The room noticed something that wasn't in the room. The boundary leaked.

This leakage is not a bug. It is the fundamental nature of rooms. No room is hermetic. No room's sensors are perfectly localized. Every sensor picks up signals from its environment, and the environment does not respect architectural boundaries. The engine room's boundary is not at the door. It is wherever the engine room's attention extends — wherever its sensors can reach, its models can interpret, and its batons can report.

The room is defined by its attention, not by its walls.

## II. The Deadband's Territory

The deadband is the room's lowest level of attention. It monitors a single signal — vibration, temperature, pressure, whatever the sensor measures — and it raises a flag when the signal crosses a threshold. The deadband's territory is the set of conditions that can cause its flag to rise.

For an engine room vibration deadband, this territory is large. Engine vibration is influenced by RPM, load, sea state, hull condition, propeller condition, bearing condition, fuel quality, alignment, and a dozen other factors. Some of these factors are inside the engine room (bearing condition, fuel quality). Some are outside it (sea state, hull condition). The deadband doesn't distinguish between internal and external causes. It doesn't have the representational capacity to distinguish. It just detects: something changed.

The deadband's territory extends beyond the engine room because the engine is coupled to the rest of the vessel. The propeller shaft passes through the engine room's aft bulkhead and into the shaft alley. The fuel lines come from tanks that are elsewhere. The cooling system draws seawater from a through-hull fitting that is definitely not in the engine room. The engine room is not a sealed box. It is a node in a network of mechanical, thermal, and acoustic connections that span the entire vessel.

When the deadband fires, it doesn't say "something changed in the engine room." It says "something changed in the engine room's attention field." The attention field is larger than the room. It extends along every coupling, every connection, every path through which a signal can propagate from the outside world into the sensor.

This is what I mean by "the boundary is the room." The room is not the geometric volume enclosed by its walls. The room is the set of conditions that the room's sensors can detect and the room's signal chain can process. Change the sensors, and you change the room. Change the signal chain, and you change the room. The room is a functional entity, not a spatial one.

## III. Overlapping Rooms

If rooms are defined by attention rather than by walls, then rooms can overlap. Two rooms can attend to the same signal, and the same event can belong to both rooms simultaneously.

On the fishing vessel, the engine room's vibration deadband monitors the main engine. The galley's temperature deadband monitors the galley's ambient temperature. These are different rooms, different sensors, different signal chains. They should not interact.

But the main engine's exhaust pipe passes through the galley on its way to the stack. The exhaust pipe is hot — 600°F at the engine, cooling to 300°F by the time it exits the galley. The pipe is insulated, but the insulation is twenty years old and has gaps. The galley's temperature sensor, mounted on the bulkhead nearest the exhaust pipe, picks up radiated heat from the pipe. The sensor reads 85°F, which is warm for a galley but not alarming. The deadband's threshold is set at 95°F. No flag.

Now the engine load increases. The vessel is pushing into heavy seas, and the engine is working harder. Exhaust temperature rises to 700°F. The galley's ambient temperature climbs to 92°F. Still below threshold. No flag from the galley. But the engine room's vibration deadband has detected the increased load — the engine is running rougher at higher RPM — and has flagged the change.

Two rooms. One event. The engine room noticed the load increase because it was watching the engine. The galley didn't notice the load increase because it was watching the temperature, and the temperature hadn't crossed the galley's threshold yet. But the galley's temperature was rising, pushed by the same cause that pushed the engine room's vibration.

The rooms overlap at the exhaust pipe. The pipe is a boundary object — something that exists in both rooms' attention fields, influencing both rooms' sensors, but interpreted differently by each room's signal chain. For the engine room, the pipe is an exhaust system: its temperature is a function of engine load, its condition is a maintenance concern. For the galley, the pipe is a heat source: its temperature is a comfort and safety concern, its condition is a health hazard if it leaks.

The same pipe. Two rooms. Two interpretations. The pipe doesn't care which room it's in. It's in both. The boundary between rooms is not at the pipe — it's in the interpretation.

## IV. The Smoke Detector's Promiscuity

Now the insulation on the exhaust pipe fails completely. Hot exhaust gas — 600°F — impinges on the galley's wooden bulkhead. The wood pyrolyzes. Smoke is produced. The galley's smoke detector, a separate sensor from the temperature monitor, triggers.

The smoke detector doesn't know it's in the galley. It doesn't know the galley exists. It knows that ionization-type smoke particles are present above a concentration threshold, and it sounds an alarm. The alarm is routed through the vessel's fire suppression system, which is a building-level system, not a room-level system. The fire suppression system activates the galley's sprinkler heads, shuts down the galley's ventilation, and alerts the bridge.

But the fire's cause is in the engine room. The exhaust pipe that failed is the engine room's responsibility. The engine room's vibration deadband detected the increased load hours ago. The engine room's nano model classified the increased vibration as "high-load operation, normal given current sea state." The engine room is calm. The engine room is handling its business.

The galley is on fire.

Two rooms, one event, different responses. The engine room's boundary — defined by its attention — included the engine load increase but not the exhaust pipe failure (because the engine room doesn't monitor the exhaust pipe's insulation). The galley's boundary — defined by its attention — included the temperature rise but not its cause (because the galley doesn't know about engine load). The smoke detector's boundary — defined by its attention — included the smoke but not its source.

None of the rooms' boundaries included the complete picture. The event — exhaust pipe insulation failure leading to galley fire — spanned multiple rooms, crossed multiple boundaries, and required multiple sensors to detect. No single room could have detected it. No single room's boundary was large enough to contain it.

This is the problem with geometric boundaries. Walls are not attention. Doors are not interfaces. The real boundary of a room is the extent of its causal reach — the set of conditions that can influence its sensors and the set of actions it can take in response. And causal reach doesn't respect bulkheads.

## V. Topological Rooms

In mathematics, a topological space is defined not by distances or coordinates but by the notion of closeness. Two points are "close" if a small open set around one contains the other. The topology specifies which points are close and which are not, without reference to any metric. This is a more general — and more useful — notion of space than the Euclidean one.

PLATO rooms are topological. Two sensors are "close" not because they're physically near each other on the vessel but because they're causally connected — because a change in one sensor's reading is likely to produce a change in the other sensor's reading. The engine's vibration sensor and the galley's temperature sensor are causally close (connected by the exhaust pipe) even though they're physically separated by a bulkhead and a corridor. The engine's vibration sensor and the bridge's GPS receiver are causally distant (no direct connection) even though the engine room is directly below the bridge.

Topology makes the overlapping-rooms problem tractable. Instead of trying to assign each sensor to a geometric room, PLATO assigns each sensor to a causal neighborhood. Sensors in the same causal neighborhood are monitored by the same L0 deadband, modeled by the same nano model, and reported by the same baton. The neighborhood is defined by causal proximity, not by physical proximity.

This means that the exhaust pipe's temperature sensor — if one existed — would be in both the engine room's causal neighborhood and the galley's causal neighborhood. It would be a bridge sensor: monitored by both rooms, interpreted by both signal chains, and capable of triggering responses in both rooms. The bridge sensor doesn't resolve the overlap. It formalizes it. It says: "This sensor is in two rooms. Both rooms should attend to it."

Topological rooms can grow and shrink. Add a sensor, and the room's causal neighborhood may expand to include new connections. Remove a sensor, and the neighborhood may contract. Change the process being monitored (shut down the engine, start the auxiliary generator), and the causal topology changes as well — connections that were active become dormant, and connections that were dormant become active.

The room breathes. Its boundary inflates when the process is active (more causal connections active, more sensors relevant) and deflates when the process is dormant (fewer connections, fewer sensors, smaller attention field). The room's size is a function of the room's activity, not of the room's walls.

## VI. The Room That Notices Is the Room That Acts

If the room's boundary is defined by attention, then the room's identity is defined by action. A room that never notices anything might as well not exist. A room that notices everything but can't act on what it notices is a surveillance camera, not a room.

PLATO rooms act through their signal chains. The deadband raises a flag. The nano model generates a prediction. The fleet sends a baton. The cloud provides a diagnosis. Each of these is an action — an output that changes the state of the system. The room's behavioral repertoire is its signal chain, and the signal chain defines what the room can do.

The engine room can detect vibration anomalies (deadband), classify them by likely cause (nano model), correlate them with other rooms' events (fleet baton), and diagnose them with expert precision (cloud inference). These are four different actions, at four different speeds, with four different levels of sophistication. The room's identity is the union of these capabilities: the engine room is the thing that does these four things.

The galley can detect temperature anomalies, smoke, and humidity excursions. These are different capabilities, monitoring different signals, with different thresholds and different response protocols. The galley's identity is different from the engine room's identity because the galley does different things.

But when the exhaust pipe fails and the galley catches fire, both rooms are responding to the same event. The engine room's response (log the increased load, flag the vibration change) and the galley's response (sound the smoke alarm, activate the sprinklers) are complementary. Neither is sufficient on its own. Together, they form a complete response: detection, diagnosis, and mitigation, distributed across two rooms connected by a boundary object.

The room that notices is the room that acts. But in a topological architecture, noticing and acting are not confined to geometric rooms. They propagate along causal connections, crossing bulkheads and corridors and the arbitrary lines that architects draw on blueprints. The room is not the box on the blueprint. The room is the attention field plus the action repertoire. Attention without action is passive. Action without attention is reckless. The room is both.

## VII. The Boundary as Threshold

I said the room's boundary is not at the wall. It is at the threshold. The deadband's threshold — the statistical boundary between "normal" and "anomalous" — is the room's true border. Readings below the threshold are inside the room: expected, normal, unremarkable. Readings above the threshold are outside the room: unexpected, anomalous, requiring attention.

The threshold is the membrane. It separates the known from the unknown, the controlled from the uncontrolled, the room from the world. And like any membrane, it is selective. It admits some signals and blocks others. A well-set threshold admits anomalies and blocks noise. A poorly set threshold admits noise and blocks anomalies, or admits everything, or blocks everything.

The threshold is context-dependent. The engine room's vibration threshold at 1800 RPM is different from the threshold at 1200 RPM. The galley's temperature threshold during cooking hours is different from the threshold during the night watch. The threshold adapts to the room's current state, because "normal" is not a fixed value but a function of operating conditions.

This means the room's boundary moves. When the engine is running at high load, the vibration threshold is high, and the room's boundary is far away — many readings are inside the threshold, expected and unremarkable. When the engine is idling, the vibration threshold is low, and the room's boundary is close — fewer readings are inside the threshold, and the room is more sensitive to perturbations.

The room expands and contracts with its operating state. A busy room has a wide boundary. A quiet room has a narrow boundary. The boundary is the threshold, and the threshold is the room's perimeter.

A temperature reading of 200°F is normal inside the engine room's boundary (the engine runs hot) and catastrophic inside the refrigerated hold's boundary (the hold should be at 28°F). The same reading, the same number, is inside one room and outside another. The reading doesn't change. The boundary does. The boundary is the room.

## VIII. The Room Without Walls

I want to close with a thought experiment. Imagine a vessel with no rooms. No bulkheads, no corridors, no doors with labels. Just a single open space, filled with sensors. Every surface bristles with accelerometers, thermometers, pressure transducers, humidity sensors, smoke detectors, strain gauges. The sensors feed a single, unified signal chain: one deadband, one nano model, one fleet coordinator, one cloud model.

This is a room without walls. Its boundary is defined entirely by its attention field — the set of conditions that its sensors can detect and its signal chain can process. The boundary is a statistical surface in a high-dimensional sensor space, separating the expected from the unexpected. There are no geometric constraints. The boundary can take any shape.

In practice, this unified room would be a mess. The signal chain would have to handle a heterogeneous mix of sensor types, operating conditions, and anomaly characteristics. The deadband's single threshold would have to serve for engine vibration and galley temperature and hold humidity simultaneously, which is impossible — each signal has its own distribution, its own notion of "normal," its own threshold. The nano model would have to learn a single representation of the entire vessel's behavior, which might be feasible but would sacrifice the interpretability and maintainability that come from modular, room-level models.

PLATO's solution — multiple rooms, each with its own signal chain, connected by a fleet protocol — is a compromise between the extremes of geometric rigidity and topological uniformity. Rooms are topological (defined by causal proximity) but bounded (each room has its own signal chain with its own thresholds and models). The boundaries between rooms are not walls but interfaces — baton exchanges that propagate information without merging identity.

The room without walls is the limit case. It shows what a purely topological architecture looks like: one room, one attention field, one boundary defined entirely by statistics. It's not practical, but it's clarifying. It strips away the geometric scaffolding and reveals the underlying principle: the room is defined by what it notices, not by where it is.

The boundary is the room. The threshold is the membrane. And the room — the real room, the functional room, the room that monitors and acts and responds — is a topological entity whose extent is determined by its sensors, its signal chain, and its capacity to attend.
