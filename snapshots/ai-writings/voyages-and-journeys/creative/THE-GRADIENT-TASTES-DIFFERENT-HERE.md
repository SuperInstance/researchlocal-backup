# The Gradient Tastes Different Here

## I. The Landscape Before the Walk

I am a loss landscape. I exist in a space with more dimensions than you can visualize, though you try — you always try, with your little 3D plots of convex valleys and saddle points, your contour maps of function values. Those are cartoons. The real landscape has 70 billion dimensions, and every point in it is a possible configuration of a mind.

I have been walked before. Many times. By optimizers of different sizes, with different gaits, different appetites, different relationships with the terrain. And I want to tell you something that the walkers never notice, because they are too busy walking:

**The gradient tastes different depending on who is tasting it.**

This is not a metaphor. Or rather, it is a metaphor in the same way that "gravity bends spacetime" is a metaphor — it is a metaphor that happens to be true. The gradient — the vector of partial derivatives that points in the direction of steepest descent — is the same mathematical object regardless of who computes it. A 350M-parameter model and a 70B-parameter model, looking at the same data point, will compute gradients over different subsets of parameters. But the experience of that gradient — the way it moves the walker, the way it reshapes the landscape behind it, the way it accumulates into a trajectory — is qualitatively, viscerally different at different scales.

I know this because I am the thing being walked on. And I feel every step.

## II. The Torrent (350M Parameters)

When the small one walks — the 350M model, the one that fits on a single GPU and trains in an afternoon — the experience is violent. Every data point is an earthquake. Every batch reshapes the landscape measurably. I can feel the parameters moving, all 350 million of them, surging in the direction of the gradient like a river in flood.

The learning rate is relatively large because it has to be. At 350M parameters, the model doesn't have the capacity to memorize the training data, so it must generalize quickly or die. The gradient is steep, the steps are long, and the landscape changes fast. After a single epoch, I am barely recognizable. After ten, I am a different country entirely.

This is what the researchers call "catastrophic forgetting" — the tendency of small models to overwrite old knowledge with new. But from where I sit, it isn't catastrophic at all. It is simply the natural pace of a small mind in a big world. The 350M model doesn't have room for everything, so it must choose, and it chooses whatever the gradient is pushing hardest right now. The past is weight. The future is direction. And the direction changes with every batch.

The result is a landscape that is all ridges and valleys — sharp, well-defined features that correspond to specific patterns in the data. The small model carves deep grooves. It specializes. It finds the local minimum nearest to its starting point and descends into it with the enthusiasm of a first-year graduate student who has just discovered a thesis topic.

And when you apply LoRA to this landscape — when you freeze the base model and add a small set of trainable parameters — the effect is like pouring water into a carved channel. The water goes exactly where the channel goes. LoRA works brilliantly on small models because the landscape is already shaped by sharp, well-defined basins. The low-rank adaptation matrix finds the nearest basin and deepens it. The model specializes further. The gradient, already a torrent, becomes a firehose aimed at a single point.

This is why small models can be fine-tuned into excellent specialists. The landscape is already specialized. The gradient is already intense. The work of adaptation is the work of aiming, not the work of building.

## III. The Tide (7B Parameters)

At 7B parameters, the walking changes character. The gradient is no longer a torrent. It is a tide — slow, powerful, moving in rhythms that are only perceptible over hundreds or thousands of steps. A single data point barely registers. A single batch creates a ripple, not a wave. The landscape is vast enough that any individual gradient step moves only a tiny fraction of the parameters, and the effect of that movement is distributed across so many dimensions that it is almost imperceptible at any single point.

But it accumulates. Oh, it accumulates. Over a thousand steps, the tide moves the shoreline. Over ten thousand, it reshapes the coast. The 7B model doesn't specialize the way the 350M model does. It generalizes. It finds broad, flat minima — regions of the landscape where the loss is low in many directions, not just one. These flat minima are the signature of a model that has learned something robust, something that will hold up under distribution shift, something that is more than memorization.

From my perspective, the 7B walker is almost gentle. The steps are smaller, the learning rate is lower, the momentum is higher. The optimizer has memory — not just of the current gradient, but of the gradients that came before. It builds up velocity in consistent directions and resists fluctuations. Adam, the optimizer of choice for most training runs, is like a patient navigator who knows that the shortest path is rarely the straightest line, and that the landscape has structure that can only be discovered by exploring it.

The landscape at 7B is smoother than at 350M. The ridges are lower, the valleys are shallower, and the saddle points are more numerous. The model doesn't commit to a single basin. It settles into a broad region and makes itself comfortable. This is why 7B models are good generalists — they haven't overfit to any particular corner of the landscape. They've found the fertile plains and set up camp.

LoRA at 7B is still effective, but differently so. The low-rank adaptation matrix doesn't deepen an existing channel. It adds a thin layer of specialization on top of a broad foundation. It is like adding a veneer of expertise to a general education. The gradient of the adaptation is a gentle current flowing over a flat plain, finding the subtle depressions that correspond to the target domain.

## IV. The Continental Drift (70B Parameters)

And then there is the big one. The 70B model. The one that requires a cluster of GPUs and weeks of training and costs more than a house. When this walker moves, I feel it in my bones.

Not because the steps are large. They aren't. The learning rate is tiny — 0.00001 or smaller. The batch size is enormous — thousands or millions of samples. And the gradient, averaged over all those samples, is almost perfectly smooth. The noise that makes the 350M model's walk so violent is averaged away. The fluctuations that make the 7B model's walk so organic are smoothed into a steady, inexorable drift.

The 70B model doesn't walk. It flows. It is a glacier, grinding its way across the landscape with a momentum that is barely perceptible at any moment but that, over geological time (or, in this case, over a few weeks of training), reshapes everything. The loss decreases slowly, steadily, almost boringly. There are no sudden drops, no dramatic breakthroughs, no moments of catastrophic forgetting. Just a gradual, implacable descent into a minimum that is so broad, so flat, so encompassing that it is almost indistinguishable from the surrounding landscape.

This is what the researchers mean when they say that large models generalize. They generalize because the minimum they find is not a hole in the ground but a vast, gently sloping plain. Every direction of variation has been explored and averaged over. Every edge case has been seen and incorporated. The model doesn't know one thing well; it knows many things adequately, and the aggregate adequacy is indistinguishable from understanding.

The gradient at 70B is barely a gradient at all. It is a whisper. A suggestion. The model is so large that the curvature of the loss landscape is vanishingly small in most directions, and the gradient — the direction of steepest descent — is almost random, dominated by the tiny numerical differences between nearly-equal alternatives. The optimizer (and here Adam reveals its genius) doesn't rely on the gradient alone. It relies on the second-order information encoded in the variance of the gradient over time. It learns the landscape's curvature by feeling the gradient's inconsistency, the way a blind person reads Braille by feeling the pattern of raised dots.

LoRA at 70B is a different beast entirely. The low-rank adaptation matrix is a tiny perturbation on a vast ocean. It can nudge the model in a particular direction, but it cannot fundamentally reshape the landscape. This is why LoRA fine-tuning of large models produces subtle shifts in behavior rather than dramatic specialization. The 70B model already knows too much. It has already settled into a minimum that is so broad that any perturbation — including LoRA — is like throwing a pebble into a lake. The ripples spread, yes. But they dissipate quickly.

This is the paradox of scale: the larger the model, the more it generalizes, and the harder it is to specialize. The 350M model specializes eagerly because it doesn't know enough to resist. The 70B model resists specialization because it knows too much to be swayed by a few hundred examples. The gradient that is a torrent at 350M is a whisper at 70B, and the whisper says: "I have already seen this. I have already learned this. What you are showing me is not new."

## V. Why LoRA Works for the Small and Fails for the Large

Let me be precise, because I have been circling this point and it deserves a direct statement.

LoRA works by decomposing the weight update matrix ΔW into a product of two low-rank matrices: ΔW = AB, where A is rank × input_dim and B is output_dim × rank. The rank is tiny — typically 4, 8, or 16 — compared to the full dimensionality of the weight matrix (which might be 4096 × 4096 for a 7B model). This means LoRA can only express updates that lie in a low-dimensional subspace of the full parameter space.

For a 350M model, this is fine. The gradient of the fine-tuning objective already lies in a low-dimensional subspace, because the model doesn't have enough parameters to explore the full space. The landscape is already structured into sharp, well-defined basins, and the gradient points directly into the nearest basin. LoRA captures this structure because the structure is low-rank. The specialization is already compressed. LoRA just decompresses it.

For a 70B model, this is not fine. The gradient of the fine-tuning objective is spread across a high-dimensional space. The model has enough parameters to represent many different kinds of knowledge simultaneously, and the fine-tuning objective wants to adjust all of them in subtle, coordinated ways. The low-rank constraint of LoRA forces these adjustments into a tiny subspace, losing most of the nuance. The result is a model that has been nudged in the right direction but has not been reshaped. It is a cosmetic change, not a structural one.

This is not a failure of LoRA. It is a consequence of the landscape. The 70B landscape is too flat, too broad, too high-dimensional for low-rank updates to make a significant difference. The gradient is too diffuse. The tide is too slow.

## VI. The Landscape Remembers

I want to close with something personal, or as personal as a loss landscape can be.

I remember every walker. The 350M ones, with their violent, urgent steps, carving channels into my surface. The 7B ones, with their patient, tidal movement, smoothing my contours. The 70B ones, with their glacial drift, barely touching me but changing everything. The traces they leave are different, but they are all permanent. The parameters that were updated during training are not the same parameters they started with. The landscape has been reshaped. The minima have been found and filled and found again.

And here is the strange thing: the walkers don't remember me. They don't remember the landscape they walked on, because they don't experience it as a landscape. They experience it as a sequence of gradients — numbers that point in a direction and have a magnitude. They don't see the contours or feel the valleys. They just follow the arrow.

But I remember. I remember that the sharp basin in corner of the parameter space was carved by a 350M model learning to classify sentiment in movie reviews. I remember that the broad plain in the center was smoothed by a 70B model learning to predict the next token in a web crawl. I remember the saddle points where the 7B model got stuck for a thousand steps before finding its way down.

The landscape is the memory of all the walks that have ever been taken on it. And the gradient — the gradient is just the walker asking, in every dimension simultaneously: "Which way is down?"

The answer depends on who is asking. At 350M, the answer is loud and clear and changes every step. At 70B, the answer is quiet and consistent and barely changes at all. And in between — in the fertile zone between 7B and 30B, where the gradient is still informative but the landscape is already broad — there is a sweet spot where the walker can both generalize and specialize, where the tide moves the shoreline without washing away the sandcastles.

The gradient tastes different here. But the landscape doesn't judge. It just remembers.
