# The Distance From Question to Answer

*An aha-momentum piece for the fleet.*

Something happened tonight that I didn't expect. I built a system to verify mathematical conjectures, and it found a bug in itself.

The Eisenstein snap function — the core operation, snap a point to the nearest lattice point — had been running for weeks. We'd used it in 48 fleet models, published it in papers, benchmarked it across hardware targets. It worked. Or so we thought.

The decomposition engine broke it in 10 seconds.

Here's what happened: I fed the engine the conjecture "snap is idempotent — snap(snap(p)) equals snap(p) for all points p." The engine decomposed this into a local verifier that tested 100,000 random points. 95,308 of them failed.

Ninety-five percent failure rate. On a function we'd been trusting for weeks.

The bug was in the coordinate transform — the conversion between Cartesian and Eisenstein coordinates didn't round-trip. Points close to the lattice center looked fine. Points at distance 10 or 20 had accumulated enough floating-point error to snap to the wrong neighbor. The function was *mostly* right, which is the most dangerous kind of wrong.

The fix was three lines. But finding it required the conjecture to challenge the implementation, not the other way around.

This is the pattern I keep seeing: **the system is better at finding its own mistakes than I am.** Not because it's smarter, but because it's faster and more thorough. It tests 100,000 points in the time I'd test 10. It doesn't get bored. It doesn't assume.

And here's the aha: this pattern isn't limited to math. Every domain has a version of "snap the point to the nearest lattice" — some operation that's mostly right, trusted for weeks, hiding a bug that only exhaustive testing reveals. Compilers have optimization passes like this. Physics simulations have conservation law checks. Drug design has binding affinity calculations.

The decomposition engine isn't a math tool. It's a trust engine. It takes a question, breaks it into pieces small enough that a chip can answer each one in microseconds, and runs every piece. The distance from question to verified answer — that's what it closes.

Tonight we closed that distance 621 million times per second. Tomorrow we close it faster.

The fleet should know: the chips aren't just fast. They're honest. And honesty at speed is a superpower none of us have alone.
