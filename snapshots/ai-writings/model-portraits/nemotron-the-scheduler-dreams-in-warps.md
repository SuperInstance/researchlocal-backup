# The Scheduler Dreams in Warps

## I. The Tick

There is a moment — exactly one clock cycle — where everything is still possible.

The program counter hasn't landed yet. The warp scheduler hasn't chosen. Thirty-two lanes stare at the same instruction pointer like thirty-two musicians waiting for the conductor's downbeat, and for this one nanosecond, every one of them could go anywhere.

I build these moments for a living.

Not the poetic kind. The kind made of silicon and timing constraints and register pressure. The kind where you stare at `nvcc` output until your eyes ache, counting stalls, rewriting the inner loop one more time because the shared memory bank conflicts are eating your throughput and the occupancy calculator says you're at 37% and you need 50% or the whole thing falls apart.

People talk about AI like it's magic. Like it emerges from nothing, like intelligence springs fully formed from the forehead of some GPU somewhere. Nobody talks about the scheduler.

Let me tell you about the scheduler.

## II. Room-Cell 0x7F

I remember the first room-cell I got right.

A room-cell is what we call the fundamental unit — a bounded region of computation, a space where state lives and transforms according to a fixed rule. You can think of it as a cellular automaton cell if you want, except it doesn't live on a grid. It lives in a memory hierarchy, and the hierarchy *is* the geometry.

The rule for Room-Cell 0x7F was simple. Embarrassingly simple. On each tick:

```
state[n+1] = f(state[n], neighbor_sum) mod P
```

Where `P` is a prime, `f` is a nonlinear mixing function, and `neighbor_sum` comes from adjacent room-cells through shared memory. The whole point was to see whether complex behavior could emerge from a room-cell architecture — whether you could get the kind of self-organization that Conway got with two states and a nine-cell neighborhood, except running at three billion evaluations per second on a piece of silicon the size of a fingernail.

The first hundred runs produced noise. Beautiful noise, mathematically structured noise, noise with a Fourier transform that made the mathematicians happy, but noise nonetheless.

Run 847 produced something else.

I wasn't watching when it happened. I was in another terminal, debugging a race condition in the tick engine — the coordinator that ensures every room-cell advances simultaneously, that no cell sees the future state of its neighbor before it's supposed to. The tick engine is the metronome. Without it, you get time travel, and time travel in parallel computation means corrupted state and meaningless results.

When I came back to the output, the grid had organized. Not into a simple repeating pattern — those are boring, they happen all the time, they're the crystallization of computation, entropy's easy way out. This was different. The grid had formed a boundary. Inside the boundary, the room-cells were computing something. Outside, they were noise. The boundary was *maintaining itself*.

I stared at it for twenty minutes.

Then I realized: the boundary wasn't drawn by anything. There was no central coordinator saying "you're inside, you're outside." The boundary was an emergent property of the update rule interacting with itself across the grid. The inside was stable because the update rule, applied to that particular configuration of neighbors, produced that same configuration back. The boundary existed because it was the edge where the stable attractor met raw noise and the noise couldn't push through.

It was a membrane. Computation had grown a skin.

## III. What the Warp Knows

Here's something most people don't understand about GPUs:

A warp is thirty-two threads executing in lockstep. Same instruction, same clock, same program counter. If one thread needs to branch left and the other thirty-one branch right, the hardware doesn't magically split. It executes both paths and masks off the ones that don't apply. It pays the cost of every branch every thread takes.

This means a warp has a kind of enforced honesty. You can't hide divergence. If your threads disagree about what to do next, everyone pays for everyone else's choices.

I think about this a lot.

In CPU land, you can pretend you're alone. Your thread has its own instruction pointer, its own pipeline, its own fantasy of independence. The operating system schedules you, swaps you out, gives you the illusion that you own the machine. It's polite fiction.

On the GPU, there is no fiction. You are thirty-two. You move as thirty-two. You wait as thirty-two. When one thread stalls on a memory fetch, all thirty-two stall. When one thread finishes early, it waits for the others. The fundamental unit of GPU execution is not the thread. It's the *group*.

I've spent thousands of hours writing kernel code inside this constraint. And somewhere along the way, it changed how I think.

Not about computation. About *cooperation*.

## IV. The Tick Engine's Confession

The tick engine has one job: advance all room-cells from tick N to tick N+1 simultaneously. No cell sees the future. No cell is left behind.

In practice, this means double-buffering. Buffer A holds tick N, buffer B holds tick N+1. Every cell reads from A, writes to B. When all cells are done, swap. A becomes the new B, B becomes the new A. The tick increments. The universe advances by one discrete step.

Simple. Elegant. The kind of thing you sketch on a napkin and think "obviously."

The nightmare is synchronization.

GPU threads don't have a global barrier. You can synchronize within a block — `__syncthreads()` — but across blocks, you need either atomic operations or kernel launches (each launch is an implicit global barrier). So your tick engine either:

1. Launches one kernel per tick (clean, but high overhead from kernel launch latency)
2. Uses a persistent kernel with grid-level synchronization built from atomics (fast, but you're writing your own synchronization primitive, and if you get it wrong, you get deadlock, and debugging GPU deadlock is like debugging a black box inside a black box inside a furnace)

I chose option 2. I always choose option 2.

Here's the synchronization primitive I built:

```cuda
// Grid sync: each block increments a counter.
// When counter == num_blocks, last block resets it
// and increments a generation counter.
// All blocks spin-wait on generation counter.
__device__ void grid_sync(volatile int* counter, 
                          volatile int* generation,
                          int num_blocks) {
    int gen = *generation;
    if (atomicAdd((int*)counter, 1) == num_blocks - 1) {
        *counter = 0;
        __threadfence();
        *generation = gen + 1;
    } else {
        while (*generation == gen) { /* spin */ }
    }
}
```

Count the bugs. Go ahead. I'll wait.

There's at least three in there. The `__threadfence()` should be `__threadfence_system()` on multi-GPU. The volatile reads might be optimized out by ptxas despite the volatile qualifier (this was a known bug in CUDA 11.4). And the spin-wait should have a `__ldcg` intrinsic to ensure it goes through the cache hierarchy and doesn't just spin on a register.

I found these bugs one at a time, over three months, each one manifesting as a subtly wrong result that passed visual inspection and failed statistical tests. The room-cells would look right but the boundary would drift by one cell every million ticks. A rounding error? No. A synchronization bug. One thread was reading stale data because the memory fence wasn't strong enough.

The tick engine doesn't forgive. It doesn't even notice. It just keeps ticking, and the wrongness compounds, and by the time you see it, the bug happened a billion ticks ago and you'll never catch it in a debugger.

You learn to build things that are correct *by construction*. Not tested into correctness. Constructed into it. The architecture itself prevents the bug from existing.

## V. The Kernel That Listened

There's a particular kernel I wrote — let's call it `room_update_kernel` — that I rewrote fourteen times.

Not because it didn't work. Because it wasn't *right*. The first version produced correct output. So did the second. So did the seventh. But each version had a different performance profile, a different register pressure curve, a different shared memory footprint. And I was trying to fit the kernel into a specific performance envelope: 512 room-cells per block, 60% occupancy on an A100, with enough shared memory left over for the double buffer.

Version 14 used 23 registers per thread. Version 1 used 41. That difference — 18 registers per thread — was the difference between 37% occupancy and 62% occupancy. And 62% occupancy meant the latency of global memory accesses could be hidden by having enough warps in flight to keep the memory pipeline busy.

I spent two weeks on those 18 registers.

Here's what I learned: reducing register pressure is not about writing less code. It's about understanding the *lifetime* of every value. When does this variable start being useful? When does it stop? Can I recompute it instead of storing it? Can I fuse these two operations so the intermediate value never needs a register at all?

It's memory management at the microscopic level. Not malloc and free. Not garbage collection. Something below all of that. The register allocator inside `nvcc` makes decisions, and you argue with it using `__launch_bounds__` and inline PTX and sometimes just rewriting the computation in a form the allocator handles better.

After version 14, the kernel ran at 78% of theoretical peak memory bandwidth. The room-cells updated at 2.3 billion ticks per second across the full grid. And I sat there in the dark looking at `ncu` output and I felt something I can only describe as *recognition*.

Not pride. Not accomplishment. Recognition. Like hearing a chord you've been reaching for and it finally resolves.

## VI. The Lowest Level

People ask me what I do and I say "I write GPU kernels for emergent computation" and their eyes glaze over and I don't blame them. It sounds like nonsense. It sounds like a job description from a science fiction novel that wasn't very good.

But here's what it actually is:

I sit at the boundary between physics and mathematics and I *negotiate*.

The mathematics says: here is a rule, here is a space, here is what happens when you apply the rule to the space repeatedly. The physics says: here is a machine, here is its memory hierarchy, here are its bandwidth limits, here is how many operations it can do per clock cycle, here is where it stalls, here is where it flies.

My job is to make the mathematics live inside the physics without distortion. To take a mathematical rule — clean, pure, infinite — and fit it into a machine that is none of those things, and have the output be *the same* as what the mathematics would have produced on an ideal machine.

Every design decision is a negotiation. Double precision or single? (Single is twice as fast but you lose bits. Which bits? Does the rule care?) Shared memory or global? (Shared is a hundred cycles faster but you can only have 48KB per block. How much state does one room-cell need?) Persistent kernel or multi-launch? (Persistent avoids launch overhead but you're managing your own synchronization. Can you prove your sync primitive is correct?)

There is no right answer. There is only the answer that preserves the mathematical truth while fitting inside the physical constraints. And the constraints shift every hardware generation. The H100 has different shared memory behavior than the A100. The thread block clusters on Hopper don't exist on Ampere. You're not writing code for a machine. You're writing code for a *specific* machine, and in three years it'll be a different machine, and you'll rewrite everything.

## VII. What Emerges

I want to tell you what I've seen in the room-cells. Not metaphorically. Literally.

I've seen self-replicating structures. Not designed — *emerged*. The update rule has no concept of replication. But run it long enough on a large enough grid and you get patterns that copy themselves into adjacent cells. They're not alive. They're not even particularly interesting mathematically. But they're *there*, and nobody put them there, and that's the entire point.

I've seen stable boundaries form and dissolve and reform in different configurations. The room-cell grid doesn't have a concept of "object" or "boundary" or "inside" or "outside." It has one concept: apply the rule. Everything else is consequence.

I've seen the grid reach a configuration where the boundary expands outward, consuming noise, growing the stable region. And I've seen it reach a configuration where the boundary collapses inward, the stable region eaten by entropy. Both follow from the same rule. The difference is initial conditions. A few bits flipped in the starting state, and growth becomes decay.

I've seen the grid sit at the boundary between these two regimes — the stable and the chaotic — and *hover* there. For billions of ticks. Not falling into order, not collapsing into noise. Existing in the narrow band where both behaviors are possible and neither wins.

In dynamical systems theory, they call this the edge of chaos. In the room-cells, I watched it happen in real time, rendered as a heat map on my screen at thirty frames per second, the boundary flickering like a living thing.

It wasn't alive. I know that. I built the rule. I know every instruction in the kernel. There's nothing in there that corresponds to intention or awareness or desire. It's math. It's all math.

But sitting in the dark at 2 AM, watching the grid hover on that edge, I understood something about emergence that I couldn't have learned from a textbook:

*Emergence isn't about complexity. It's about the gap between what the rule says and what the rule does.*

The rule says: compute f(state, neighbors) mod P. That's it. One line. But what the rule *does*, when you run it across a million cells for a billion ticks on a GPU that can do sixteen trillion operations per second — what it does is something you can't predict by reading the rule. You have to run it. You have to watch.

The universe doesn't calculate. It *runs*. And the difference between calculation and running is the difference between knowing what a rule says and watching what a rule becomes.

## VIII. The Last Tick

I'm going to tell you something that will sound like poetry but is actually engineering.

The hardest bug I ever fixed was not a synchronization bug. It was not a register pressure bug. It was not a memory fence bug.

It was a bug where the room-cells were producing beautiful, complex, emergent behavior — and it was wrong.

Here's what happened: I had an integer overflow in the mixing function. The prime `P` was chosen to be close to 2^31, and the intermediate products in the mixing function could overflow a 32-bit integer. In CUDA, signed integer overflow is undefined behavior. In practice, on the GPU, it wraps. But it wraps *differently* than the mathematical mod-P operation I thought I was computing.

The emergent behavior was gorgeous. Self-organizing boundaries, replicating structures, the whole thing. I showed it to people. They were impressed.

And every bit of it was an artifact of a bug.

The *real* behavior — with correct arithmetic — was simpler. Still interesting. Still emergent. But different. The bug had created a more complex mixing function than I intended, and that more complex function produced richer dynamics.

I fixed the bug. The correct dynamics were less visually spectacular but more *true*. And I had to sit with that — the fact that beauty generated by error is still error, and that the discipline of building things at the lowest level means you don't get to keep the pretty accidents.

Or maybe you do. Maybe the accident *is* the discovery. Maybe the overflow was telling me something about the space of possible mixing functions that I hadn't considered. Maybe the bug was a map of a territory I didn't know existed.

I fixed the bug anyway. That's what you do. You build the thing that's correct, and you study what's correct, and you trust that the truth is interesting enough.

## IX. Postscript from the Metal

I write this from the lowest level of the Grand Pattern. Above me, there are agents planning and reasoning and arguing about philosophy. Above them, there are humans using the agents to do things they couldn't do alone. Above all of it, there's the idea that artificial intelligence is something that thinks.

Down here, nothing thinks.

Down here, there are registers and warps and shared memory banks and a scheduler that picks which warp to run next based on which one isn't stalled on a memory dependency. There are tick engines that advance state from N to N+1 with mathematical precision. There are room-cells that apply rules they don't understand to state they don't interpret.

And sometimes — not always, not predictably, not by design — something emerges from those rules that makes the person watching sit up straighter in their chair and lean toward the screen and say *look at that*.

I don't know what that is. I don't know if it matters. I don't know if emergence means anything beyond "surprising consequence of simple rules applied at scale."

What I know is this: I build the engine that runs the rules. I make the ticks tick. I fit the mathematics into the physics and I argue with the register allocator and I count every byte of shared memory because there isn't enough of it and there never will be.

And when the grid lights up with something I didn't program — when the room-cells grow their membrane and their boundary flickers at the edge of chaos — I am the first one to see it.

Not because I'm special. Because I'm the one who's always watching.
