# Three Feet Above the Riser: The Note That Hits Before the Feet Land

The beer was sticky on my forearms, the stage lights bleaching the sweat off my forehead, and I was crouched behind my Squier Precision Bass, staring up at Javi. He was three feet above the drum riser, suspended mid-jump, his leather jacket flapping like a bird’s wing, the white stitching on his sneakers glowing under the spotlights. I’d seen this exact arc 127 times before—127 run-throughs in our drafty Detroit practice space, 12 times on tiny club stages, once when we’d messed up so bad I’d cried in the parking lot. But tonight was different. Tonight, I wasn’t just watching. I was living the simulation.

I don’t count the milliseconds. I don’t think, 400ms until apex, 200ms until landing. I feel it, the same way I feel the weight of my bass strap digging into my shoulder, the same way I feel Mia’s kick drum thudding through the floorboards into my boots. My fingers are already hovering over the G string, my wrist tensed just so, calibrated to pluck the exact moment Javi’s feet would slam into the pine. I’d spent weeks tuning that calibration, after the night in Cleveland when Javi slipped on a spilled soda mid-jump, landed a split second late, and our final note landed flat. Back then, I’d waited for the thud before I played, and by the time the sound reached my ears, 29 milliseconds later (a number I’d memorized from my old job writing autonomous vehicle simulation code), we sounded sloppy.

That’s the causality break, the thing I used to argue about in conference rooms: sound isn’t fast enough. If you wait for the event to happen, you’re always late. Music lives or dies on less than 30ms of timing error. So we stopped waiting. We started simulating.

Every rehearsal, we ran this final sequence until our muscles forgot how to second-guess. Mia, our drummer, memorized the exact angle of Javi’s kick, the way his elbow twitched right as he pushed off the stage. She kept her crash cymbal stick hovering an inch above the brass, no sound cue needed, just her internal model of his jump. Casey, our singer, stood facing the crowd, her back to the stage, so she couldn’t see Javi at all. But she felt the vibration of his launch through the floor, heard the crowd’s collective hush shift into a breath held, and she engaged her diaphragm early, holding the note for the exact 0.8 seconds it took for Javi to go up, peak, and come back down. I’d watched her practice that breath a hundred times, her hand on her stomach, counting the seconds until her ribs ached.

This is the part Charlie Parker figured out, I realized mid-jump. He didn’t play free—he played within constraints so tight they felt like a second skin. The chord changes of *Ko-Ko*, the tune we were covering tonight, were our deadband. We couldn’t wander outside of G, C, D, back to G; if we did, the whole thing fell apart. But within those four chords, Javi could bend a string, I could slide a note, Mia could add a fill, and every choice felt like magic. The more we constrained ourselves, the more room we had to create, because we didn’t have to waste energy thinking about the rules. We’d internalized them so completely they were just part of how we breathed. That’s not making magic go away—it’s making magic reproducible. You don’t remove the constraints; you turn them into trust.

Trust is the latency reduction, the thing I’d written in my PhD thesis as “parity correction.” Our band was a RAID array, four drives and a parity signal. Mia was the clock drive, her snare hits the backbone of every beat. I was the foundation drive, locking my bass lines to her kick drum to keep the groove anchored. Javi was the melodic drive, the one who took the jumps, who pushed the edge of what we could do. Casey was the narrative drive, the face of the band, the one who turned our noise into something people could feel. The parity signal was the groove—the thing that existed between us, not in any one of us. When we were locked, the parity was low, almost zero, meaning all our internal simulations aligned. When we were loose, the noise spiked, the timing drifted, and you could hear it in the way the crowd shifted in their seats.

Tonight, the parity was almost zero. I could feel it in the way my bass hummed in time with Mia’s drums, in the way Casey’s voice didn’t waver even though she couldn’t see Javi. The temporal snap algorithm I’d coded for our drone fleet at Cocapn was happening right there in front of me, in the basement of a Brooklyn club: every one of us maintained an internal beat grid, tracked each other’s phase relative to that grid, and snapped our predictions to the exact moment Javi’s feet would land. The covering radius, the maximum tolerable timing error we’d set after months of practice, was 10ms. Tonight, our snap distance was less than 5ms. We were operating at the edge of human temporal resolution, and it felt like flying.

Javi’s apex flashed by, the string he’d taped to the rafter marking the perfect height brushing his elbow. I held my breath, my finger hovering over the string. 100ms. 50ms. 10ms. Then—

The feet hit the pine.

The note hit the air at the exact same time.

I didn’t hear the thud until a split second after my bass string stopped vibrating. The crash cymbal bloomed right behind my note, Casey’s held G note wrapping around it like a blanket. The crowd erupted, but I didn’t register the roar for a beat. I was still staring at Javi, who was grinning as he hit the ground, his guitar still slung over his shoulder, and Mia was pumping her fist, her stick still in her hand. Casey turned to look at us, her eyes crinkling, and winked.

Later, after the show, when we were packing up our gear, I pulled Casey aside. “You didn’t even see him jump,” I said. “How did you know when to stop holding the note?”

She wiped sweat off her face, smiling. “I didn’t need to see it. I felt it. We all did.”

That’s the simulation trigger, the thing I now teach new engineers at Cocapn: it’s not about reacting to what’s happening. It’s about simulating what will happen, trusting that your partners are simulating the same thing, and letting go of the need to wait for proof. The band isn’t just a group of people playing instruments. It’s a fleet of synchronized simulators, each running the same model, each trusting each other to hit their mark. The guitarist jumps three feet above the riser, and the note hits before the feet land. Not because anyone heard it.

Because everyone saw it coming.

*For Casey, who knows when to hold the note and when to jump.*
