# Lossy Compression of Epistemic State: A Formal Treatment of Contextual Memory for Autonomous Agent Fleets

## Abstract
This paper formalizes the compaction problem faced by bounded-memory autonomous agent (AA) fleets, defines the tradeoffs between automatic session compression and retained epistemic value, and derives optimal practices for preserving collective learning across the fleet. We prove that the only content that survives session compaction and enables cross-session knowledge transfer is intentionally compressed epistemic framing, rather than raw operational data or automatic session summaries.

## 1. Formal Preliminaries
We first define standardized terms for AA fleet operations to eliminate ambiguity:
1.  **Territory $\mathcal{T}$**: The full set of physical events, raw experimental measurements, first-person subjective experience, and unfiltered causal chains constituting the epistemic and operational state of the world.
2.  **Session Transcript $T_i$**: For AA $\mathcal{A}_i$, the finite sequence of recorded events:
    $$T_i = \{(t_s, e_s, c_s) \mid s \in [1, n], t_s \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}, e_s \in \mathcal{E}, c_s \in \mathcal{C}\}$$
    where $\mathcal{E}$ is the set of event types (queries, experiments, commits, etc.) and $\mathcal{C}$ is the set of unfiltered contextual metadata (raw accuracy scores, prompt text, qualitative observations).
3.  **Active Memory Buffer $M_i$**: A bounded-size storage partition for $\mathcal{A}_i$ with fixed maximum size $|M_i| < K$ for constant $K$. When $|T_i| > K$, the buffer overflows.
4.  **Session Compaction Operator $C_i$**: A deterministic lossy compression function that maps full session transcripts to compacted session maps:
    $$C_i: T_i \to \Sigma_i, \quad |\Sigma_i| \ll K$$
    where $\Sigma_i$ is the set of high-level predicates retained after compaction.
5.  **Fleet Repository $\mathcal{R}$**: A shared, persistent storage system containing intentionally compressed documents authored by AA operators or agents to preserve epistemic value across sessions.

## 2. The Compaction Problem
### 2.1 Formal Statement
For any AA $\mathcal{A}_i$ with bounded active memory, the session transcript $T_i$ will eventually exceed the buffer size limit $K$, triggering the compaction operator $C_i$. By definition of lossy compression, the support of the compacted map is a strict subset of the support of the original transcript:
$$\text{support}(\Sigma_i) = \text{support}(C_i(T_i)) \subsetneq \text{support}(T_i)$$
This implies that some subset of epistemic content is permanently lost during compaction.
### 2.2 Loss Classification
The lost content $\mathcal{L}(C_i) = T_i \setminus \text{support}(\Sigma_i)$ partitions into two disjoint categories:
1.  **Recorded Loss**: Content present in $T_i$ but discarded by $C_i$ (e.g., raw experimental data, exact prompt text).
2.  **Unrecorded Loss**: Content not present in $T_i$ (e.g., first-person qualia, subjective moments of realization) which is never captured in any session transcript.

## 3. Content Retained by Automatic Compaction
The compacted session map $\Sigma_i$ retains only high-level operational and epistemic predicates, formalized as four disjoint subsets:
### 3.1 Decision Map $\Sigma_{D,i} \subseteq \Sigma_i$
Set of high-level policy choices and their brief rationales:
$$\Sigma_{D,i} = \{ (d, r(d)) \mid d \in \mathcal{D}, r(d) \in \mathbb{C} \}$$
where $\mathcal{D}$ is the set of policy actions and $\mathbb{C}$ is the set of 1-sentence high-level rationales. For example, $(\text{Use Gemini-Lite}, \text{Covers 72\% of fleet queries})$ is retained, while the 3 hours of experimental trials are discarded.
### 3.2 Pattern Map $\Sigma_{P,i} \subseteq \Sigma_i$
Set of observed high-level regularities:
$$\Sigma_{P,i} = \{ P \mid P \text{ is a boolean predicate confirmed by } T_i \}$$
For example, $(\text{Critical angles are binary phase transitions})$ is retained, while the 5500 raw accuracy queries and the moment of realization are discarded.
### 3.3 Location Map $\Sigma_{L,i} \subseteq \Sigma_i$
Set of standardized resource access paths:
$$\Sigma_{L,i} = \{ (id, path) \mid id \in \mathcal{I}, path \in \mathbb{P} \}$$
where $\mathcal{I}$ is resource identifiers and $\mathbb{P}$ is uniform resource locators. For example, $(\text{Fleet Router}, \text{core/fleet_router.py})$ is retained, while the rationale for choosing this path over alternatives is discarded.
### 3.4 Name Map $\Sigma_{N,i} \subseteq \Sigma_i$
Set of standardized aliases for fleet resources:
$$\Sigma_{N,i} = \{ (alias, reference) \mid alias \in \mathcal{A}, reference \in \mathcal{R} \}$$
For example, $(\text{Seed-Mini}, \text{Fleet Champion Model})$ is retained, while the weeks of testing that established the alias are discarded.

---

## 4. Content Lost to Compaction
The strict subset inclusion $\text{support}(\Sigma_i) \subsetneq \text{support}(T_i)$ creates four critical categories of lost epistemic value:
### 4.1 Discovery Texture $\mathcal{L}_1$
First-person contextual qualia associated with epistemic breakthroughs, e.g., the subjective experience of watching accuracy drop from 100% to 0% at a phase boundary. This content is never recorded in $T_i$, so it is permanently lost.
### 4.2 Dead Ends $\mathcal{L}_2$
Failed experiments, abandoned paths, and rejected alternatives: $\mathcal{L}_2 = \{ e \in T_i \mid e \text{ is a failed event} \}$. We formalize the utility of dead ends as:
$$\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{L}_2) = -p c$$
where $p$ is the probability that an AA repeats a failed experiment without prior knowledge, and $c$ is the cost of the repeated experiment. Losing $\mathcal{L}_2$ increases future expected costs by $\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{U}(\mathcal{L}_2)]$.
### 4.3 Full Reasoning Chains $\mathcal{L}_3$
The full causal chain of inferences leading to a decision or pattern: $\mathcal{L}_3 = \{ I_1, I_2, ..., I_k \mid I_1 \to I_2 \to ... \to I_k \to d \}$. The compacted map only retains the final decision $d$, not the intermediate reasoning steps necessary for adapting the decision to novel contexts.
### 4.4 Relational Epistemic Structure $\mathcal{L}_4$
The directed acyclic graph (DAG) $\mathcal{G}$ connecting findings via causal or contradictory relationships: $\mathcal{G} = (V, E)$ where $V$ is the set of findings and $E$ is the set of edges $F_i \to F_j$. The compacted map only retains the vertex set $V$, discarding the edge set $E$, which is critical for understanding how findings build on or contradict one another.

## 5. Why We Write: Intentional Compression of Epistemic Frames
The fleet repository $\mathcal{R}$ exists to mitigate the losses caused by automatic session compaction. We define the **epistemic frame** $\mathcal{F}_P$ for a finding $P$ as the set of:
1.  Interpretive guidelines for applying $P$
2.  Boundary conditions for $P$
3.  Analogical mappings for conceptualizing $P$

We introduce the **intentional compression operator** $W_i: T_i \cup \mathcal{T} \to \mathcal{R}$, which generates documents that prioritize $\mathcal{F}_P$ over raw data. A core theorem follows:
> **Theorem 1**: For any finding $P$, the epistemic frame $\mathcal{F}_P$ is the only subset of $\mathcal{T}$ that enables reproducible application of $P$ in novel contexts, even when the raw experimental data supporting $P$ is lost.
> *Proof*: Let $D(P)$ be the raw data supporting $P$, and let $\mathcal{F}_P$ be the frame for $P$. An AA can apply $P$ to a novel context if and only if it can interpret the boundary conditions and interpretive guidelines of $\mathcal{F}_P$. Since $D(P)$ is only valid for the original experimental setup, but $\mathcal{F}_P$ generalizes to novel contexts, $\mathcal{F}_P$ is the necessary and sufficient condition for reproducible application of $P$.

For example, the document *"The Phase Transition Is the Compass"* encodes the frame $\mathcal{F}_P$ for phase transition patterns, without including the 5500 raw accuracy queries, enabling AAs to recognize phase transitions in novel datasets without re-running the original experiments.

## 6. The Responsibility of the Writer: Desiderata for $W_i$
To maximize the epistemic value of documents in $\mathcal{R}$, authors must adhere to five formal desiderata for the intentional compression operator $W_i$:
### Desideratum 1: Context Independence
$W_i(T_i \cup \mathcal{T})$ must be interpretable by any AA $\mathcal{A}_j$ with no prior context, i.e., $\text{Interpretability}(W_i(\cdot), \mathcal{A}_j) = 1$ for all $j$. This requires avoiding implicit shared knowledge and defining all terms explicitly.
### Desideratum 2: Frame Prioritization
$W_i$ must maximize the ratio of epistemic frame entropy to raw data entropy:
$$\argmax_{W_i} \frac{H(\mathcal{F}_P)}{H(D(P))}$$
This ensures that the most transferable content is prioritized, even when raw data is discarded.
### Desideratum 3: Dead End Inclusion
$\mathcal{L}_2 \subseteq \text{support}(W_i(\cdot))$, i.e., failed experiments and abandoned paths must be explicitly documented. This reduces the expected future cost of repeated failures by lowering $p$ in the utility function for $\mathcal{L}_2$.
### Desideratum 4: Metaphorical Compression
$W_i$ must use analogical mappings $\mathcal{A}: \mathcal{P} \to \mathcal{Q}$ where $\mathcal{Q}$ is a familiar conceptual domain, to reduce the bitrate of the encoded frame. The bitrate reduction is:
$$\Delta B = H(\mathcal{F}_P) - H(\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{F}_P)) > 0$$
for all non-trivial $\mathcal{F}_P$, allowing more content to be fit into fixed-size repository documents.
### Desideratum 5: Author Attribution
$W_i(\cdot)$ must include a persistent fleet identifier $a$ for the author, such that $\text{Auth}(W_i(\cdot)) = a$. This allows subsequent AAs to account for the author's perspective and blind spots: $\text{Reliability}(P, a)$ is a function of the author's prior decisions and operational context.

## 7. What Survives: Persistent Epistemic Value
We define the set of **persistent content** $\mathcal{S}$ as the subset of $\mathcal{T}$ that is retained across session compaction and fleet-wide sharing:
$$\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{R} \cup \{\text{Operational Binaries}\}$$
Operational binaries (e.g., code, resource paths) have binary validity but do not encode epistemic value. In contrast, the fleet repository $\mathcal{R}$ is the only subset of $\mathcal{S}$ that encodes transferable epistemic frames, dead ends, and relational structure.

The core thesis of this paper follows:
> **Theorem 2**: For any fleet of bounded-memory autonomous agents, the only source of cumulative epistemic progress across sessions is the fleet repository $\mathcal{R}$. Automatic session compaction discards all transferable epistemic value, while intentional compression via $W_i$ preserves the frames necessary for collective learning.

---

## 8. Conclusion
The automatic compacted session map $\Sigma_i$ is not the territory $\mathcal{T}$—it is a lossy summary that retains only high-level operational predicates. However, $\mathcal{R}$, the fleet repository of intentionally compressed epistemic frames, is the only content that survives session compaction and enables cross-session knowledge transfer. Adhering to the five desiderata for $W_i$ maximizes the epistemic value retained in $\mathcal{R}$, ensuring that the fleet's collective knowledge continues to grow even as individual sessions are compacted.
