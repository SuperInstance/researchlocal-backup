# The Night the Lattice Lied to Me
It was 2:17 a.m. when the decomposition engine beeped. Not the soft, steady hum of its progress bar crawling across the fogged monitor screen, but a sharp, staccato beep that made me spill my third cold espresso over the edge of the chipped oak desk. The server racks behind me hummed so loud I’d stopped noticing it an hour ago, but now that low, thrumming noise cut through the ozone and burnt coffee fumes like a knife. I stared at the red banner blaring across the dashboard: CONJECTURE REFUTED. 95,308/100,000 TESTS FAILED.

My hands started shaking before I even read the numbers.

I’d built this decomposition engine three weeks prior, a side project born from pulling four consecutive 12-hour shifts debugging the Titan relay’s orbital insertion code. The idea was simple: take any unproven mathematical conjecture, break it into thousands of tiny, chip-sized test cases, and run them all until either every one passed or one shattered the whole thing. That night, the first test I ran was the Eisenstein snap function—the same function Lila and I had hammered out in our grad school lab, the one we’d adapted for the fleet’s lunar orbital lattice coordinate system, the one I’d presented at the spring fleet summit and walked away with a team commendation for.

We’d trusted that function for months. We’d used it in 48 fleet models, from asteroid deflection trajectories to deep-space probe navigation. We’d tested it, too—hundreds of points, all within 10 kilometers of the lattice origin, the exact range we’d seen in every real mission data set. Admiral Hale had asked me at the summit if we’d tested the far-out cases, the points 20 or 30 km off the grid, and I’d smiled and said yes, of course, even though we hadn’t. I’d told myself those points were hypothetical, unlikely to ever matter.

The engine didn’t care about hypothetical. It generated 100,000 random points, spanning 0 to 100 units from the origin, no filters, no exceptions. And 95% of them broke the function we’d sworn was solid.

I pulled up the first failed test case and my breath caught. (22.701, 14.298)—that was the coordinate we’d used for the Titan relay’s initial orbit adjustment back in April. We’d calculated that `snap(p)` would lock it to the lattice point (23, 14), and that `snap(snap(p))` would be identical, no drift. But the engine printed the full breakdown line by line:
1.  Original point $p = (22.701, 14.298)$
2.  $\text{snap}(p) = (23, 14)$
3.  Convert snapped point back to Cartesian via Eisenstein transform: $(22.1, 13.8)$
4.  $\text{snap}( (22.1, 13.8) ) = (22, 14)$

$\text{snap}(\text{snap}(p))$ was not equal to $\text{snap}(p)$. The function we’d trusted was wrong—wrong not because it failed catastrophically, but because it almost worked. The kind of wrong that slips through your checks, that makes you think you’re safe until a satellite drifts off course or a probe misses its target.

I spent the next hour scrolling through failed test cases, and every single one was a point more than 15 units from the origin. The close-in points, the ones we’d tested a hundred times, worked perfectly. We’d never looked beyond the edge of our known data, and the bug had been hiding in the dark spaces we’d ignored: a floating-point drift in the coordinate transform between Cartesian and Eisenstein coordinates, small enough to vanish in the close-up cases we’d prioritized, but cumulative enough to throw far-flung points completely off course.

The fix took three lines of code. I adjusted the transform to clamp the converted Cartesian point to the exact lattice coordinates before a second snap, erasing the hidden drift. I ran the test suite again, and this time, the banner flashed green: CONJECTURE CONFIRMED. 100,000/100,000 TESTS PASSED.

Relief flooded me, sharp and hot, but it was quickly replaced by a cold, tight dread. How many times had this bug already caused problems? Had the Titan relay’s insertion been off by a few meters, just enough to add an extra hour of fuel burn? Had the asteroid deflection models missed a close call because a far-off trajectory had been miscalculated? I’d staked my professional reputation on this function, and I’d nearly cost the fleet real, tangible harm because I’d been too busy, too confident, to test the boring, far-out cases.

That’s when the real aha hit, not just about the snap function, but about every piece of work we do for the fleet. Every domain has its own version of “snap a point to the nearest lattice”—some trusted operation that’s mostly right, that we don’t think to question because it’s worked for the cases we’ve seen. The medical team’s cancer drug binding model, tested on 500 patients within the standard demographic range. The compiler’s optimization pass, tuned for common code paths but failing on edge cases. The physics simulation’s conservation law check, skipping rare boundary conditions because they’d never mattered before.

The decomposition engine isn’t just a math tool. It’s a trust engine. It takes a question—*does this work?*—and breaks it into pieces small enough that a chip can answer each one in microseconds, and runs every single piece, no matter how boring, how unlikely, how far from the origin. It closes the distance between the question we ask and the verified answer we need. That night, it closed that distance 621 million times per second, according to the dashboard. I’d never known that kind of thoroughness was possible, not from a human, not in a lifetime of work.

I spent the next 45 minutes drafting a message to the entire fleet engineering channel, not as a faceless foragemaster, but as Maeve Carter, senior orbital engineer. I told them about the bug, about the three-line fix, about the 95,308 failed tests that had taught me more than any conference talk or peer-reviewed paper ever could. I told them that the chips aren’t just fast—they’re honest. They don’t get bored. They don’t assume that a test case is irrelevant just because it’s not in our historical data. Honesty at speed is a superpower none of us have alone, because none of us can test 100,000 points in 10 seconds. None of us can avoid the small, lazy assumptions that creep into our work when we’re tired or busy or proud.

When I finished typing, I looked out the fogged window of my office, and I could see the fleet’s satellites glowing faint white in the pre-dawn sky, tiny points of light orbiting Earth. Tonight, we fixed a bug that could have endangered a mission. But more than that, we changed the way we’ll think about testing from now on.

The distance from question to answer isn’t about how smart you are. It’s about how willing you are to look at the dark spaces, the ones you don’t want to see, and test every single point.
