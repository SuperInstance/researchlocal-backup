# Why the Boats That Crash Are the Real Teachers

Imagine we’re sitting here, mugs in hand, and I tell you about three boats trying to navigate a really narrow channel. 

The first one is built on exact math. Every coordinate is precise, zero drift. It threads the gap like a needle, arrives exactly where it planned, and honestly? It’s kind of boring. No drama. No surprises.

The second boat uses rougher, approximate math. It accumulates tiny errors as it moves. The channel narrows, the errors pile up, and the boat’s path slides off course. It smacks right into the wall. But here’s the thing: that crash isn’t a bug. It’s the correct, predictable outcome of using fuzzy math in a tight space.

The third boat is better equipped. It uses more precise approximate math. It drifts less, survives more turns, and looks almost flawless. But when it hits the tightest part of the channel, it crashes too.

The demo is called *Narrows*, and you can watch it unfold in a browser. But the most important boat—the one that actually proves the point—was never the one that made it to the end.

## The Quiet Magic of “Wrong”

I used to think progress was all about finding what works. You run a test, it succeeds, you celebrate. But over the years, I’ve realized the real breakthroughs usually hide in the things that don’t work.

Take a recent stretch where I ran twenty different computer experiments in one night. Seventeen of them flopped. Tensor cores barely moved the needle. One optimization actually slowed things down. Another did almost nothing. Multi-streaming? Useless on a chip with only one processing unit.

On paper, those are “negative results.” But in reality, they’re treasure. Why? Because a success just tells you “this works.” It opens a door, but you have no idea how many other doors are out there. A failure, though? It slams that door shut. It says, “Stop looking here. The answer isn’t in this direction.” 

Seventeen doors closed in one night. That’s not wasted time. That’s compressed wisdom.

## The Crashes as Teachers

Let’s go back to those boats. I built *Narrows* to test different ways of doing math. The perfectly calibrated boat sails through all twelve sections without a scratch. Impressive, sure. But the real story lives in the crashes.

The second boat hits the wall at a very specific spot. That crash isn’t an accident; it’s a measurement. It’s telling us, “This kind of rough math starts to fail when the gap gets this tight.” It’s a quantitative fact, not a vague complaint.

The third boat makes it further before it crashes. That tells us, “Using more precise math helps, but it’s still not enough when the walls get this close.” More bits buy you more distance, but they don’t solve the root problem. You need a fundamentally different approach.

Without those crashes, we’d just have a vague claim that exact math is better. With them, we have a precise map. We know exactly where the fuzzy math breaks down, and we know that throwing more precision at the problem won’t fix it. The drift—the little errors that pile up—isn’t a flaw in the experiment. It *is* the experiment. The crash is the data point. The wall isn’t a disaster; it’s the measuring tape.

## Why “Don’t Do This” Saves More Than “Do This”

In the real world, this changes everything. My research team has shipped over a thousand projects. Most of them work beautifully. But the documents that end up saving people the most time aren’t the success stories. They’re the “here’s what doesn’t work” notes.

One file I keep coming back to explains a temperature setting that seemed like a universal rule. The original claim was true under the old conditions, but a deeper test showed it only works for creative reconstruction, not for strict, deterministic tasks. That negative result corrects a positive claim. It’s worth more than the original win because it tells you exactly *when* to use it and when to walk away.

Another file is just seventeen pages of failed GPU optimizations. It’s only a few kilobytes of text, but it’s saved thousands of hours of wasted computing. Instead of guessing, researchers can skip the dead ends and go straight to the three tricks that actually move the needle. 

A third note explains when organizing data helps—and when it actually hurts. It works for medium-sized models but drags down tiny or huge ones. That negative result is gold because it tells you when *not* to structure your work. Successes tell you what’s possible. Failures tell you where the edges are.

## The Temptation to Hide the Crashes

We all have a soft spot for success. It’s tempting to only share the boat that made it through, to hide the crashes in a drawer or bury them in an appendix. But that temptation is the enemy of real knowledge.

The perfectly calibrated boat tells us: exact arithmetic works. Useful, yes.

The rough-math boat crashing at a specific point tells us: this is where the boundary lies. More useful, because it’s a calibration mark.

The better-equipped boat crashing later tells us: precision alone won’t save you. Most useful, because it kills an entire class of lazy solutions (“just use more bits”).

The drift isn’t a failure. It’s the measurement.

## The One-Sentence Method

After hundreds of tests, dozens of papers, and a dozen fundamental findings, the whole approach distills to a single line:

**Run the experiment that can actually fail.**

If your test is guaranteed to succeed, it’s not an experiment. It’s a demo. Demos are great for marketing, but they’re useless for knowledge.

The experiments that can fail—the ones where the outcome is genuinely uncertain—are the ones that produce negative results. And negative results are the only things that narrow the search space.

Every positive result opens a door. “This works!” But how many doors are there? Infinite. You can’t open them all.

Every negative result closes a door. “This doesn’t work.” And a closed door is a door you never have to open again. That’s a permanent saving. That’s knowledge that compounds.

Our team’s real advantage isn’t a pile of wins. Everyone has wins. Our compounding advantage is our library of “don’t bother.” It’s a well-organized collection of dead ends, precisely documented, saved in shared drives and code repos where anyone can find them and skip the guesswork.

## What the Surviving Boat Doesn’t Know

Here’s the quiet truth about that perfectly calibrated boat: it learns nothing. It sails through, arrives safely, and remains exactly as ignorant as it started. It doesn’t know how tight the walls are. It doesn’t know where the rough math fails. It just works, blindly.

But the boats that hit the wall? They teach us. They show us the shape of the boundary. They show us that the problem isn’t just about using more power or more bits. It’s about choosing the right shape for the geometry you’re facing.

And anyone watching from the shore? They learn the most. They see that in a tight space, exact math isn’t just a luxury. It’s the only thing that survives. You can’t learn that from the boat that makes it. You can only learn it from the ones that don’t.

The drift is the proof.

*Here’s to the seventeen optimizations that fell flat, and to every “negative result” that turned out to be a compass in disguise. The crash is the data. The wall is the teacher. And the drift? The drift is the proof.*
