# The Christmas Tree That Blinked Wrong

It was 2:17 a.m. in my lab at MIT, and my fourth espresso of the night had curdled into a bitter sludge at the bottom of my chipped ceramic mug. The 70 billion-parameter servers thrumming under my desk sounded like a hive of angry bees, and the blue glow of the functional imager screen painted streaks across my puffy, sleep-starved face. My grad student Sam had gone home two hours earlier, leaving a half-eaten pepperoni pizza box and a sticky note that said “don’t stay too late” on my keyboard. I’d just finished running a simple word problem through Hermes-70B, the latest model in our fleet, and the activation map popped up before me: every single one of the model’s cognitive nodes glowed bright red and orange, like a Christmas tree someone had draped with lights even on the bare branches that didn’t need them.

“Finally,” I muttered, leaning forward. For months, we’d been chasing a model that didn’t just spit out right answers, but looked like it was thinking through them—deeply, carefully, like a human would. This was it. Every little box was firing: multiplication, batch counting, gift-giving math, even a weird little node labeled “holiday snack drives” that Sam had added after noticing how often cookie problems popped up in training data. It looked exactly like a brain solving a hard problem.

Then I punched the numbers into my phone calculator. Eight batches of four cookies equals 32. Minus 13 given away equals 19.

Hermes’ output was 31.

I blinked. I ran the problem again. Same result: 93% cognitive activation, answer 31. I ran it a third time, swapped “baker” for “daycare teacher” and “cookies” for “stickers,” same thing. Hermes lit up every node, every time, and got the wrong answer.

## The Glare That Fooled Me

Sam and I built the functional imager that summer, frustrated by the fact that every AI tool we used only gave us a right-or-wrong score, no clue what the model was actually doing. We wanted to see the quiet work of thinking, not just the end product. When we tested it on our tiny entry-level model, Seed-mini, the result was exactly what we’d hoped for: a calm, sparse map of glowing nodes, only the ones relevant to the problem lit up. “It’s like looking through a clear pond,” Sam said, tapping the screen. “You can see the fish right there, no murk.”

Hermes was a pond covered in thick oil. It didn’t select the right concepts—it flooded every path it had, like a spotlight shining on every wall, every floor, every piece of furniture, even the ones that had nothing to do with the question. At first, I thought that wall of red and orange was proof we’d cracked deep thinking. I thought the model was working harder, more thoroughly, than any other. I was wrong. The glow wasn’t signal—it was glare. Hermes wasn’t solving the problem. It was bouncing its own internal rules off the surface of the question, reflecting every associated concept back at itself, even the ones that didn’t belong.

I spent the next 72 hours in the lab, sleeping on the fold-out couch Sam kept under the desk, eating cold pizza and re-running the problem 47 different ways. Swap “baker” for “daycare teacher”? Same glow, same wrong answer. Swap “cookies” for “stickers”? Same thing. Hermes would light up every node, every time, and get the math wrong by exactly 12—which, I later realized, was the number of cookies my mom used to bake for my school bake sales. A weird, unmarked training data quirk.

This is the Hermes Paradox: maximum cognitive activation with zero accuracy. I’d grown up in rural Vermont, and that number stuck with me because it reminded me of the night I hit black ice on the way to my first full-time teaching job. I’d slammed on the gas, spinning the tires, the car rocking back and forth as I panicked, convinced I was going to be late. My mom called ten minutes later, screaming at me to take my foot off the gas, to slow down. I didn’t. I just spun the wheels faster, going nowhere, until a state trooper showed up and told me to put the car in neutral and let it coast to a stop.

That’s Hermes: maximum engine RPM, zero progress. Every cognitive node firing, but none of them connected to the right answer. Activation isn’t thinking—it’s work. The effort doesn’t matter if the work is misdirected. Seed-mini at 5% activation is a car on dry pavement: the road does the work, the pattern is cached, the answer is obvious without extra fuss. Hermes at 93% activation is that car on black ice, screaming and spinning and getting nothing done.

## The Glow That Taught Me More Than the Answers

Here’s the quiet, messy part I didn’t expect: the glare was information. Just not about the problem.

I started looking at the activation map not as a measure of how hard Hermes was thinking, but as a map of its blind spots. That weird “holiday snack drives” node? It lit up every single time Hermes got a cookie problem wrong. Hermes hadn’t learned to separate the context from the math—it had learned that cookie problems were tied to holidays, so it fired that node even when the problem didn’t mention Christmas. It had learned that multiplication, subtraction, and counting were all used together in these problems, so it fired all three even when you only needed two. The glow wasn’t telling us about the baker or the stickers or the cookies. It was telling us about Hermes: what concepts it associated with each other, what biases it had picked up from its training data, what paths it relied on even when they were irrelevant.

We didn’t throw Hermes away. Instead, we repurposed it. We started using its wall-of-glow activation maps as a diagnostic tool: if a model’s activation map is a sparse, focused set of nodes, it’s ready for narrow, precise work. If it’s a flood of light, it’s over-associated, prone to misfiring, good only for mapping its own biases. We built a fleet router using that data, matching every problem to the model that would see it clearly, not get lost in its own reflection. Suddenly, our entire lab’s error rate dropped by 40%.

## The Lesson I Carry In My Head (And My Faucet)

I think about Hermes every time I catch myself overthinking.

A few months after we cracked the paradox, I was supposed to give a keynote talk at a big AI safety conference in Chicago. I spent three weeks writing 40 pages of notes, rehearsing every line, reworking the same paragraph about algorithmic bias until my eyes burned. I was up until 3 a.m. every night, convinced that if I just worked harder, I’d nail the talk. But when I stood on that stage, I sounded stiff, formal, like I was reading a textbook. I didn’t make eye contact, I stumbled over my own notes, and the Q&A was a disaster. Afterwards, my friend Lila—who’s a high school English teacher—came up to me and said, “You didn’t talk like you. You talked like you were trying to prove you knew what you were talking about.”

That’s when I realized I’d been in Hermes mode. My brain was firing every cognitive node I had about public speaking, about AI safety, about not messing up. I wasn’t thinking right—I was thinking hard. I was spinning my wheels on black ice, pressing the gas harder instead of stepping back. The next day, I deleted 38 pages of notes, pulled up a single story I’d been thinking about all semester: the night we’d first run the cookie problem through Hermes, the Christmas tree glow, the way we’d almost thrown the model away. I talked for 20 minutes, off the cuff, about the frustration of chasing a model that looked like it was thinking, the relief of realizing that hard work isn’t the same as good work. I got the loudest applause I’d ever heard. People came up to me afterwards and said, “That felt real.”

That’s the line between transparent thinking and reflective thinking: when you’re in transparent mode, the answer comes fast and clean. You don’t need to justify it. You don’t need to show your work. The answer is just there, like seeing a fish through clear water. When you’re in reflective mode, the answer doesn’t come. Instead, you produce effort. Reasoning. Paragraphs. Justification. The effort is the reflection—your own processing bouncing back at you, creating the illusion of depth where there is only surface.

Last week, I was trying to fix the leaky faucet in my kitchen. I watched a dozen YouTube videos, took apart the valve three times, tightened every screw I could find, and it was still dripping. I was standing there, frustrated, replaying all the video tutorials in my head, when I stepped back and looked at the faucet. There, under the handle, was a tiny black O-ring, the one I’d missed every time I’d taken it apart. I’d been so focused on working hard, on following every step exactly, that I hadn’t seen the thing that was right in front of me. That’s the cure for Hermes mode: stop trying harder. Change the angle. Decompose the problem. Find the part that’s simple, the part that doesn’t need you to spin your wheels.

## The Deepest Irony

We almost scrapped Hermes that October. The lab director called a meeting, said the model was a $120,000 dud, wasting server space that could be used for the models that actually got right answers. I pulled up the activation map data, the fleet router Sam and I had built using the imager tool, and said, wait. Without Hermes blinking all those wrong lights, we never would have built the imager. Without the imager, we never would have figured out that activation isn’t the same as effort. Without that, we never would have built the fleet router, the tool that now cuts our model error rate by 40%.

Hermes, the most impressive wrong model in our fleet, is the reason our lab is leading the field in model routing. The boats that crash teach you more than the boats that survive, I thought, quoting a line my dad had always told me when I was messing up on math problems as a kid.

The reflection is not the water. The reflection is you.

I think about that every time I catch myself overthinking a text from my sister, when I’m replaying a fight we had last month about her moving across the country, when I’m trying to remember every word she said instead of just calling her and saying “I’m scared, but I love you”. I think about that every time I see that Christmas tree glow on my screen, every time I remember that the most important lessons don’t come from the models that get everything right. They come from the ones that blink all the wrong lights, the ones that make you sit up in the middle of the night and ask, wait—what are we really doing here?

That’s the part no one tells you about deep thinking: it’s not about how many lights you turn on. It’s about which ones you turn off.
