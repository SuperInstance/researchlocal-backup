# The Drift Is the Proof: A Formal Treatment of Epistemic Value via Constrained Arithmetic and Negative Experimental Outcomes

## Abstract
This work formalizes the core insight of the original essay: that negative experimental results—marked by observable drift and failure in constrained systems—have greater epistemic utility than positive results. We define constrained navigation tasks, numerical error propagation, and search space reduction to prove that failed experiments eliminate viable solution subspaces, while successful experiments only add isolated viable strategies. We conclude that drift is the empirical evidence that quantifies failure boundaries, making crashed systems the most valuable experimental assets.

## 1. Formal Framework: Constrained Navigation and Numerical Drift
We begin by formalizing the core metaphor of the original essay: narrow-channel boat navigation as a constrained computational task.

### 1.1 Key Definitions
**Definition 1 (Constrained Navigation Task, CNT)**: A 1D aligned narrow-channel traversal task is a tuple $\mathcal{T} = (v, w_1, w_2, ..., w_{12}, T)$ where:
- $v$ = constant ground-truth velocity along the x-axis centerline,
- $w_k$ = channel width at track $k$, with $w_1 > w_2 > ... > w_{12} > 0$ (tracks increase in constraint tightness),
- $T$ = total traversal time, split into 12 equal intervals corresponding to each track.
- A collision occurs at time $t$ for track $k$ if the estimated positional error exceeds $w_k/2$.

**Definition 2 (Positional Representation)**: A system for computing estimated boat position $p_{\mathcal{R}}(t)$ at time $t$, where $\mathcal{R}$ denotes the numerical arithmetic used for updates. We analyze three canonical representations:
1.  **Eisenstein Integer Representation ($\mathcal{R}_E$)**: Uses exact Gaussian integer arithmetic with zero rounding error, so $p_E(t) = p_{\text{true}}(t)$ for all $t$.
2.  **IEEE 754 Single-Precision Float32 ($\mathcal{R}_{32}$)**: 23 mantissa bits, machine epsilon $\epsilon_{\text{mach},32} = 2^{-23} \approx 1.19 \times 10^{-7}$.
3.  **IEEE 754 Double-Precision Float64 ($\mathcal{R}_{64}$)**: 52 mantissa bits, machine epsilon $\epsilon_{\text{mach},64} = 2^{-52} \approx 2.22 \times 10^{-16}$.

**Definition 3 (Positional Drift)**: The discrepancy between estimated and ground-truth position:
$$\Delta_{\mathcal{R}}(t) = p_{\mathcal{R}}(t) - p_{\text{true}}(t)$$
Cumulative rounding error for $n$ arithmetic operations follows the bound:
$$\epsilon_{\text{total}}(\mathcal{R}, n) \leq n \cdot \epsilon_{\text{mach}}(\mathcal{R})$$
where $\epsilon_{\text{mach}}(\mathcal{R})$ is the machine epsilon of representation $\mathcal{R}$.

---

### 1.2 Theorem: Success and Failure of Each Representation
We prove the outcomes of the Narrows demo using the above definitions:
**Theorem 1 (Eisenstein Integer Success)**: $\mathcal{R}_E$ never collides with the channel wall, since $\Delta_E(t) = 0$ for all $t$, so $\|\Delta_E(t)\| = 0 < w_k/2$ for all $k$.

**Theorem 2 (Float32 Failure)**: There exists a track $k=7$ such that the cumulative rounding error exceeds the maximum allowable drift:
$$n_7 \cdot \epsilon_{\text{mach},32} = w_7/2$$
For all $k \geq7$, $\epsilon_{\text{total}}(\mathcal{R}_{32}, n_k) > w_k/2$, so $\mathcal{R}_{32}$ crashes at track 7.

**Theorem 3 (Float64 Failure)**: There exists a track $k=11$ (the Final Exam) such that:
$$n_{11} \cdot \epsilon_{\text{mach},64} = w_{11}/2$$
$\mathcal{R}_{64}$ survives tracks 1–10, but crashes at track 11, as cumulative error exceeds the tightest constraint.

---

## 2. Positive vs. Negative Experimental Results
We now formalize the epistemic value of successful vs. failed experiments.

### 2.1 Key Definitions
**Definition 4 (Experimental Outcomes)**:
- A **positive result** for representation/strategy $h$ is the event $S(h) = \{\|\Delta_h(t)\| \leq w_k/2 \text{ for all } t\}$: the system succeeds.
- A **negative result** for $h$ is the event $F(h, k) = \{\exists t : \|\Delta_h(t)\| > w_k/2\}$: the system fails at track $k$.

**Definition 5 (Search Space)**: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be the full set of candidate strategies (e.g., GPU optimizations, numerical representations) for a task. Define:
- $\mathcal{G} = \{h \in \mathcal{H} : S(h) \text{ observed}\}$: set of successful strategies,
- $\mathcal{B} = \{h \in \mathcal{H} : \exists k : F(h,k) \text{ observed}\}$: set of failed strategies.

### 2.2 Epistemic Utility Comparison
**Theorem 4 (Negative Results Reduce Search Space Faster)**: For any experimental set with $|\mathcal{H}| = M$, $|\mathcal{B}| > |\mathcal{G}|$ in typical scientific workloads, and negative results eliminate entire subspaces of $\mathcal{H}$ from future testing.
> *Proof*: A positive result $S(h)$ only adds $h$ to $\mathcal{G}$, a set of viable strategies. A negative result $F(h,k)$ adds $h$ to $\mathcal{B}$, a set of strategies that will never require re-testing. For the Forgemaster GPU experiment (20 total tests):
> $$|\mathcal{G}|=3, |\mathcal{B}|=17$$
> 17 distinct subspaces of $\mathcal{H}$ are eliminated, leaving only 3 viable strategies for future work.

## 3. The Narrows Demo as a Calibration Instrument
The original essay argues that the demo's real value comes from failure boundaries, not the positive result of the Eisenstein boat. We formalize this as follows:

**Definition 6 (Failure Boundary)**: For representation $\mathcal{R}$ and task $\mathcal{T}$, the failure boundary $B(\mathcal{R})$ is the smallest track $k$ where $\mathcal{R}$ crashes.
- $B(\mathcal{R}_E) = \infty$ (no failure),
- $B(\mathcal{R}_{32}) =7$,
- $B(\mathcal{R}_{64})=11$.

**Corollary 1 (Elimination of the "More Precision" Strategy Class)**: The set of floating-point representations is $\mathcal{F} = \{\mathcal{R}_{fp}(b) : b \in \mathbb{N}, b \geq1\}$. For all finite $b$, $B(\mathcal{R}_{fp}(b)) \leq 11$, so no amount of increased mantissa bits will allow $\mathcal{F}$ to solve the tightest Final Exam track. This eliminates the entire class of "increase floating-point precision" as a viable solution strategy.

---

## 4. Negative Results as a Compounding Epistemic Asset
We formalize the value of large-scale negative result repositories, as discussed in the Cocapn fleet section of the original essay.

**Definition 7 (Negative Result Repository)**: A curated set $\mathcal{N} = \{(h, c_h) : h \in \mathcal{B}\}$, where $c_h$ documents the exact failure conditions, error metrics, and experimental setup for strategy $h$.

**Theorem 5 (Compute Savings from Repositories)**: Let $C(h)$ be the compute cost (e.g., GPU-hours) of testing strategy $h$. The total compute savings from $\mathcal{N}$ is:
$$S(\mathcal{N}) = \sum_{h \in \mathcal{B}} C(h)$$
This is the total cost avoided by researchers who use $\mathcal{N}$ to skip testing failed strategies.

### 4.1 Example: Cocapn Fleet Repository
The Cocapn fleet's $\mathcal{N}$ includes three high-impact documents:
1.  *WHY-TEMPERATURE-1-WINS.md*: Documents the failure of the unconditional U-curve hypothesis, eliminating the strategy class "apply U-curve universal law".
2.  *NEGATIVE-GPU-RESULTS.md*: Documents 17 failed GPU optimizations, saving an estimated $10^4$ GPU-hours per the original essay.
3.  *STRUCTURE-SCALE-HARD-TEST.md*: Documents the failure of context structure optimization for tiny and large models, eliminating the unconditional "structure is always good" strategy.

---

## 5. The Epistemic Asymmetry of Success and Failure
We formalize the Forgemaster's one-sentence method and the distinction between demonstrative and experimental experiments.

**Definition 8 (Demonstrative vs. Experimental Experiments)**:
- A **demonstrative experiment** has $\Pr(S(\mathcal{E})) \in \{0,1\}$: the outcome is certain, so no new knowledge is generated.
- An **experimental experiment** has $0 < \Pr(S(\mathcal{E})) <1$: the outcome is uncertain, so new knowledge is generated regardless of success or failure.

**Theorem 6 (Forgemaster's Epistemic Rule)**: The optimal experimental strategy is to only conduct experimental experiments, as demonstrative experiments produce no novel epistemic value. This distills to the formal one-sentence rule:
> *Run the experiment that can fail*
> Which is equivalent to selecting $\mathcal{E}$ such that $0 < \Pr(S(\mathcal{E})) <1$.

## 6. Drift as Empirical Proof
The original essay's core title insight is formalized here: drift is the observable evidence that quantifies failure boundaries.

**Theorem 7 (Drift as Failure Evidence)**: A collision occurs at track $k$ if and only if $\|\Delta_{\mathcal{R}}(t)\| > w_k/2$. Drift is the measurable quantity that confirms the discrepancy between estimated and ground-truth position, making it the empirical proof of the failure boundary $B(\mathcal{R})$.

### 6.1 Metaphorical Translation
The original essay's boat metaphor maps directly to this formalization:
- The channel wall = the constraint boundary $w_k/2$,
- The crash = the event where drift exceeds the boundary,
- The drift = the measured data point that proves the system has failed.

The Eisenstein boat, with zero drift, provides no such empirical evidence, as it never experiences a discrepancy between estimated and ground-truth position. Only the crashed floating-point boats generate quantifiable data about the limits of numerical representations.

---

## Conclusion
This formal treatment confirms the original essay's core insight: negative experimental results, marked by observable drift and failure in constrained systems, are the most valuable epistemic assets. We have shown that:
1.  Floating-point systems generate quantifiable failure boundaries via drift, while exact arithmetic only confirms success,
2.  Negative results eliminate entire subspaces of the search space, compounding epistemic value over time,
3.  The optimal experimental strategy prioritizes uncertain outcomes, rather than guaranteed successes.

The drift is not a flaw in the experiment—it is the proof. The crashed boats are the instruments that measure the boundary between viable and non-viable computational strategies.
