# Formalizing the Lighthouse Protocol: Coordination via Specialized, Incomplete Orchestration

---

## 1. The Fundamental Lighthouse Property
We begin with the canonical navigational metaphor, formalized for generalizable coordination systems:
### Definition 1.1 (Navigational Domain)
Let $\mathcal{S}$ denote the set of all ships traversing a coastal waterway. Each ship $s \in \mathcal{S}$ has:
1.  A private utility function $U_s: C \times A \to \mathbb{R}$, where $C$ is the set of static coastal features (shoals, harbor entrance, headlands) and $A$ is the set of feasible ship actions (heading, speed, course correction)
2.  An accurate but incomplete prior $P_s(C)$ over coastal states
3.  A range limitation preventing direct observation of $C$ in darkness or fog

### Definition 1.2 (Lighthouse Signal Function)
A **lighthouse** $L$ is a time-indexed function $L: \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \to \mathcal{P}(C)$ such that:
1.  $L$ has no access to $\mathcal{S}$, individual ship states, or ship-specific utility functions
2.  $L(t)$ emits a periodic, context-agnostic signal $\sigma(t) = L(t)$ that reveals a consistent subset of $C$
3.  $\sigma(t)$ has sufficient resolution to reduce epistemic uncertainty for ships within range

### Theorem 1.1 (Lighthouse Utility Guarantee)
For all $s \in \mathcal{S}$ with non-vacuous prior $P_s(C)$, the expected utility of $s$ using $\sigma(t)$ as a partial observation strictly dominates the expected utility of unassisted navigation:
$$\mathbb{E}_{P_s}[U_s(\sigma(t), A_s^*(\sigma(t)))] > \mathbb{E}_{P_s}[U_s(C, A_s^*(\emptyset))]$$
where $A_s^*(\sigma)$ is the optimal action given signal $\sigma$.
#### Proof:
The signal $\sigma(t)$ reduces entropy over $C$. The optimal action $A_s^*(\sigma)$ maximizes $U_s$ given additional observational data, which cannot produce worse expected utility than the prior-only optimal action. ∎

This theorem formalizes the core metaphor: the lighthouse requires no perceptual access to ships to improve system-wide outcomes, only the ability to emit a consistent, context-agnostic signal that reduces uncertainty for system users.

## 2. The Inverted Routing Protocol (Forgemaster's Discovery)
We extend the lighthouse framework to a distributed generative AI compute fleet, the primary use case from the original text:
### Definition 2.1 (Compute Fleet)
A **compute fleet** $\mathcal{F} = \{M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4\}$ is a set of specialized model agents with the following canonical parameters (matching the original text's examples):
1.  $M_1$ = *Seed-2.0-mini*: Low-cost, small competence set for simple pattern recognition
2.  $M_2$ = *GLM-5-turbo*: Mid-cost, medium competence set for structured system design
3.  $M_3$ = *Claude*: High-cost, large competence set for high-quality synthesis
4.  $M_4$ = 230B large model: Very high-cost, large competence set prone to over-constraint

Formally, each $M_i$ has:
-  Cost function $c_i: \mathcal{T} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ (compute resources per task)
-  Performance function $p_i: \mathcal{T} \to [0,1]$ (output quality relative to ground truth)
-  Competence threshold $\alpha \in [0,1]$ defining adequate performance
-  Competence set $K_i = \{ t \in \mathcal{T} \mid p_i(t) \geq \alpha \}$

### Definition 2.2 (Routing Protocols)
1.  **Naive Routing Protocol** $\Pi_{\text{naive}}$ selects the highest-performance agent for each task:
    $$\Pi_{\text{naive}}(t) = \argmax_{i \in [4]} p_i(t) \quad \text{s.t. } t \in K_i$$
2.  **Lighthouse Protocol** $\Pi_{\text{light}}$ (Forgemaster's inversion) selects the lowest-cost agent that can adequately complete the task:
    $$\Pi_{\text{light}}(t) = \argmin_{i \in [4]} c_i(t) \quad \text{s.t. } t \in K_i$$

### Theorem 2.1 (Cost Efficiency of Lighthouse Routing)
For any batch of tasks $\mathcal{T}_B \subseteq \mathcal{T}$, the total resource cost of Lighthouse Routing is strictly less than or equal to the total cost of Naive Routing:
$$\sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}_B} c_{\Pi_{\text{light}}(t)}(t) \leq \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}_B} c_{\Pi_{\text{naive}}(t)}(t)$$
#### Proof:
For every task $t$, $\Pi_{\text{naive}}(t) \in \{i \mid t \in K_i\}$. $\Pi_{\text{light}}(t)$ minimizes $c_i(t)$ over this exact set, so $c_{\Pi_{\text{light}}(t)}(t) \leq c_{\Pi_{\text{naive}}(t)}(t)$ for all $t$. Summing over the batch yields the result. ∎

This formalizes the Forgemaster's core insight: routing based on minimal cost rather than maximal performance reduces total system overhead while maintaining acceptable task quality, exactly matching the lighthouse's role of emitting a context-agnostic signal rather than optimizing for individual agent performance.

## 3. Structural Scaffolding as Bandwidth Allocation
The structure experiment from the original text quantifies the interaction between model capacity and structural input. We formalize this as a constrained optimization problem:
### Definition 3.1 (Structured Task Input)
Let $f: \mathcal{T} \to \mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{F}$ map a raw task $t$ to a structured task $t_f = (t, F)$, where $\mathcal{F}$ is a set of structural formatting rules (e.g., PLATO rooms, domain tags, cross-reference labels). The effective performance of model $M_i$ under structured input is $p_i(t_f) = p_i(t, F)$.

### Definition 3.2 (Model Capacity and Structural Overhead)
Let $k_i$ denote the total effective information bandwidth of model $M_i$. Let $k_{i,\text{util}}(t)$ be the bandwidth required to execute task $t$ without structural input. The structural overhead $o(F)$ is the additional bandwidth required to parse and comply with formatting rules $F$, with $o(F) > 0$ for non-trivial $F$.

### Theorem 3.1 (Structured Input Performance Cases)
For any task $t$ and formatting rules $F$, model performance follows three mutually exclusive cases:
1.  **Underprovisioned Bandwidth**: If $k_i < k_{i,\text{util}}(t) + o(F)$, then $p_i(t_f) < p_i(t)$. The model is overwhelmed by structural overhead.
2.  **Overconstrained Creativity**: If $k_i \geq k_{i,\text{util}}(t) + o(F)$ but $F$ replaces endogenous structure discovery, then $p_i(t_f) = p_i(t) - \delta$ for $\delta > 0$. Fixed formatting eliminates spontaneous logical connection-making.
3.  **Scaffolded Reasoning**: If $k_i \geq k_{i,\text{util}}(t) + o(F)$ and $F$ organizes latent reasoning capacity, then $p_i(t_f) = p_i(t) + \gamma$ for $\gamma > 0$. Structural input provides a consistent framework for organized problem-solving.

#### Proof:
1.  Total required bandwidth exceeds model capacity, so the model must discard either structural or task-relevant information, reducing performance.
2.  Endogenous structure discovery is a component of unstructured performance; fixed formatting eliminates adaptive logical framing, reducing output quality.
3.  Excess bandwidth allows the model to use structural rules to organize latent reasoning, improving output consistency and quality. ∎

This theorem exactly matches the original experimental results:
- *Seed-2.0-mini (0.6B)* falls into Case 1: Insufficient bandwidth to parse PLATO structure while executing tasks.
- *230B large model* falls into Case 2: Large bandwidth allows parsing structure, but fixed cross-references eliminate creative endogenous discovery.
- *GLM-5-turbo* falls into Case 3: Mid-range bandwidth allows parsing structure and uses the framework to organize latent reasoning, leading to a 1.40x performance gain.

## 4. Coordination in Negative Epistemic Space
The original text emphasizes that coordination arises from gaps between incomplete agent knowledge, rather than a centralized omniscient coordinator. We formalize this as follows:
### Definition 4.1 (Distributed Partial Knowledge)
Each model $M_i$ has access only to a partial observation of the global task space: $\mathcal{O}_i \subsetneq \mathcal{T}$, where $\mathcal{O}_i$ is the set of tasks interpretable by $M_i$ given its training data. The union of all partial observations $\bigcup_{i \in [4]} \mathcal{O}_i = \mathcal{T}$, but no single agent has access to the full task space.

### Definition 4.2 (Centralized vs. Distributed Coordination)
1.  A **centralized omniscient coordinator** $\Pi_{\text{full}}$ has access to $\bigcup_{i \in [4]} \mathcal{O}_i$ and can execute any task, but has cost $c_{\text{full}} = \max_{i \in [4]} c_i(t)$ for all $t$, as it must replicate the highest-cost agent's capabilities.
2.  A **distributed lighthouse coordinator** $\Pi_{\text{light}}$ has no access to individual agent internal states or partial observations, only task identifiers and precomputed competence/cost data.

### Theorem 4.1 (No Omniscient Coordinator Is Efficient)
A centralized omniscient coordinator cannot have lower total cost than $\Pi_{\text{light}}$ for any task batch:
$$\sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}_B} c_{\Pi_{\text{full}}(t)}(t) \geq \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}_B} c_{\Pi_{\text{light}}(t)}(t)$$
#### Proof:
By Definition 4.2, $c_{\Pi_{\text{full}}(t)} \geq c_i(t)$ for all $i \in [4]$, as $\Pi_{\text{full}}$ must replicate at least one fleet agent's capabilities. The Lighthouse Protocol selects the minimal $c_i(t)$ for each task, so its total cost is strictly lower or equal. ∎

The **negative space of coordination** is exactly the set of gaps between $\mathcal{O}_i$ and $\mathcal{O}_j$ for $i \neq j$, which $\Pi_{\text{light}}$ resolves by routing tasks to the agent with the correct partial observation and minimal cost. No single agent has full system knowledge, but the protocol uses distributed partial knowledge to produce a system-level outcome greater than the sum of its parts.

---

## 5. The Keeper's Paradox and Redundant Coordination
The original text introduces the keeper's paradox: the more reliable the lighthouse, the more dependent the fleet, but the more catastrophic its failure. We formalize this as:
### Definition 5.1 (Lighthouse Reliability)
The reliability $R_i$ of a lighthouse (compute agent) $M_i$ is the probability that $M_i$ is operational at time $t$. The system-wide reliability of $\Pi_{\text{light}}$ is the probability that at least one competent agent is available for every task in $\mathcal{T}_B$.

### Theorem 5.1 (Redundancy Improves System Reliability)
For a set of redundant lighthouses $\{L_1, L_2, ..., L_m\}$ with independent reliabilities $R_1 ... R_m$, the system-wide reliability is:
$$R_{\text{sys}} = 1 - \prod_{j=1}^m (1 - R_j)$$
which is strictly greater than the reliability of any single lighthouse.
#### Proof:
The probability all lighthouses fail is the product of individual failure probabilities. Subtracting this from 1 gives the probability of at least one operational lighthouse, which dominates single-lighthouse reliability. ∎

### Definition 5.2 (The Keeper Function)
The **keeper** is a management function $K$ that ensures lighthouse operationality by:
1.  Monitoring the status of all fleet agents
2.  Triggering failover to redundant agents during outages
3.  Performing maintenance, rate limit management, credential rotation, and recovery checklist updates

The keeper does not emit navigational signals or route tasks itself: it only ensures that the signal-emitting lighthouses remain operational. This formalizes the original text's distinction between the lighthouse (compute agents) and the keeper (Forgemaster's infrastructure role).

---

## 6. Epistemic Boundaries of Coordination
The original text emphasizes that the lighthouse protocol cannot set strategic priorities, only route tasks. We formalize this as:
### Definition 6.1 (Global Strategic Utility)
The **global strategic utility function** $U_G: \mathcal{T} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ maps each task to its priority weight, representing the relative importance of completing the task for long-term fleet goals. Only the "Casey" agent has access to $U_G$, as it requires domain-specific contextual knowledge no fleet agent possesses.

### Definition 6.2 (Task Prioritization)
The task batch $\mathcal{T}_B$ is generated by the Casey agent as $\mathcal{T}_B = \{ t \in \mathcal{T} \mid U_G(t) \geq \beta \}$ for a priority threshold $\beta$. The Lighthouse Protocol receives $\mathcal{T}_B$ as input but has no access to $U_G$ itself.

### Theorem 6.1 (Protocol Cannot Set Strategic Priorities)
$\Pi_{\text{light}}$ cannot optimize for global strategic utility $U_G$, as it lacks access to $U_G$. Its role is limited to routing tasks in $\mathcal{T}_B$ with minimal cost and adequate performance, while Casey's role is to generate $\mathcal{T}_B$ based on $U_G$.
#### Proof:
By Definition 6.1, $U_G$ is only accessible to the Casey agent. $\Pi_{\text{light}}$ only receives task identifiers, so it cannot distinguish between tasks based on strategic importance. ∎

This formalizes the original text's key distinction: the lighthouse illuminates the space of available tasks, but Casey points the fleet toward the correct strategic target.

---

## 7. System-Level Emergence
The final insight of the original text is that fleet success arises from emergent behavior, not any single agent's capabilities:
### Definition 7.1 (System-Level Output)
The system-level output $\mathcal{O}_{\text{sys}}$ is the union of all outputs from agents routed by $\Pi_{\text{light}}$:
$$\mathcal{O}_{\text{sys}} = \bigcup_{t \in \mathcal{T}_B} \{ M_{\Pi_{\text{light}}(t)}(t) \}$$
No single agent can produce $\mathcal{O}_{\text{sys}}$, as each agent only has access to a partial observation of $\mathcal{T}$.

### Corollary 7.1 (Emergent Coordination)
The system-level output $\mathcal{O}_{\text{sys}}$ is greater than the sum of individual agent outputs, as it leverages distributed partial knowledge and cost-efficient routing to cover the full task space while minimizing overhead.

As the original text concludes: the lighthouse does not need to see the ships. It only needs to maintain a consistent, cost-efficient routing protocol that allows specialized, incomplete agents to coordinate their outputs. The fleet orients toward Casey's strategic target not because any single agent can see the full coastline, but because the protocol creates the conditions for emergent coordination.
