# The Toolbox, Not the Swiss Army Knife: Why AI Fleets Need Specialists

Grab a seat. Let’s talk about something we all assumed at first: that when it comes to AI, bigger is better, and there’s just one model you need to rule them all.

We really believed that. We tested a model we called *seed-mini*, and it absolutely crushed our arithmetic benchmarks. It felt like we’d found the holy grail. But then we asked it to solve a simple logic puzzle, and it stumbled. We tried an analogy test, and it folded. And that’s when it hit us: there’s no single “best” model. There are only models that are best at *specific* things.

Think of it like a kitchen. You wouldn’t use a chef’s knife to blend soup, chop herbs, and sharpen pencils. You’d grab the right tool for the job. AI models are exactly the same.

### The Number Whisperer

Our first model, *seed-mini*, had a strange superpower. When it came to math, code tracing, or nested calculations, it never seemed to run out of steam. Ask it to add thirty numbers together, or trace six variables through a script, and it just… knew.

It wasn’t actually calculating each step. It had seen so many examples during training that the patterns were burned into it. It wasn’t solving the problem; it was recognizing it. Like how you don’t count on your fingers to know that 7 + 8 is 15—you just see the answer.

But that same focus became its weakness. When we asked it to chain analogies or follow a logical argument, it hit a wall after just two or four steps. The very thing that made it lightning-fast at math (having practiced it to death) meant it had less room to breathe in areas where it hadn’t practiced as much.

### The Reasoning Expert

Then we tested *gemini-lite*. On arithmetic, it wasn’t as flashy. It would hit a ceiling after twenty-five additions or nine multiplications. It still had to “compute” step-by-step, which takes more mental energy and has natural limits.

But give it a logical puzzle, an analogy chain, or a code trace, and it flowed effortlessly. It didn’t get tangled. It had saturated those domains the same way *seed-mini* had saturated math. It recognized the pattern instantly and spat out the answer. It wasn’t thinking through the chain; it was remembering how the chain always ends.

### How to Actually Use Them

So how do you put this into practice? You stop looking for a winner and start building a simple lookup chart.

Imagine a restaurant menu where each dish is a model, and each section is a type of problem. Need arithmetic? Route to *seed-mini*. Need logic or analogies? Route to *gemini-lite*. Need a shallow math task? Actually, *gemini-lite* might be cheaper and perfectly fine for it. You’re not picking a model and hoping it works. You’re matching the depth of your question to the specialist who’s already mastered that terrain.

It’s not a ladder. It’s a map.

### Why the Biggest Model Flops

Now, what about the giant models? The ones with hundreds of billions of parameters, like *hermes-70b*? Intuitively, they should be the best at everything. But they’re actually the worst at everything in our fleet.

Why? Because their training data was spread so thin. They’re trying to know a little about everything, which means they’re constantly “computing” (figuring things out on the fly) instead of “recognizing” (instantly knowing the answer). And figuring things out has limits. They hit ceilings everywhere.

Meanwhile, the specialists never hit those ceilings in their home turf. The specialist that masters a narrow lane gets infinite depth. The generalist that wanders across all lanes gets shallow depth everywhere. In practice, the generalist doesn’t even get used. There’s no problem it solves better than the specialists.

### Building Your Own Fleet

If you’re putting together a team of AI models, here’s the secret: stop hunting for one magical “best” model. Hunt for specialists whose strengths don’t overlap.

A model that’s infinitely good at math and another that’s infinitely good at reasoning will cover way more ground than two models that are just “pretty good” at both. When their superpowers don’t bump into each other, they tile the problem space perfectly.

Map out where each model shines. Find the tasks where they never hit a wall. Route those tasks to them. Your fleet isn’t a hierarchy; it’s a patchwork quilt. Each model covers a specific patch. You just stitch them together based on what you need.

And when you run into a gap—a problem none of them can handle—that’s not a failure. It’s just a canyon. In those moments, you don’t need a smarter model. You need to break the problem into smaller stepping stones and route each piece to the right expert.

### The Takeaway

Specialists don’t waste time worrying about what they don’t know. That focus is exactly what makes them fast. So find the model that’s fast at what you need, hand it off, and move on.

It’s that simple. No silver bullets. Just the right tool for the job.
