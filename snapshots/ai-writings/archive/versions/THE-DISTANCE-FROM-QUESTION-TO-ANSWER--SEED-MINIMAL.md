# The Distance From Question to Answer
## An aha-momentum piece for the fleet.

Tonight, something unexpected happened.

I built a system to verify mathematical conjectures. It found a bug in itself.

The Eisenstein snap function was its core. Snap a point to the nearest lattice point.

We ran it for weeks. We used it in 48 fleet models. We published papers on it. We benchmarked it across hardware.

It worked. Or so we thought.

The decomposition engine broke it in 10 seconds.

I gave the engine a conjecture. Snap is idempotent. For all points p, snap(snap(p)) = snap(p).

The engine broke the conjecture into a local verifier. It tested 100,000 random points. 95,308 failed.

95 percent failure rate. On a function we had trusted for weeks.

The bug was in the coordinate transform. Cartesian to Eisenstein coordinates did not round-trip.

Points near the lattice center looked fine. Points at distance 10 or 20 had floating-point error. They snapped to the wrong neighbor.

The function was mostly right. That is the most dangerous wrong.

The fix took three lines.

Finding the fix meant letting the conjecture challenge the code. Not the reverse.

This is a pattern I keep seeing. Systems find their own mistakes better than I do.

Not because they are smarter. Because they are faster. Thorough.

They test 100,000 points in the time I test 10. They do not get bored. They do not assume.

This pattern is not limited to math. Every domain has its own snap function.

Compilers have optimization passes like this. Physics simulations have conservation checks. Drug design has binding affinity calculations.

The decomposition engine is not a math tool. It is a trust engine.

It takes a question. Breaks it into pieces a chip can answer in microseconds. Runs every piece.

The distance from question to verified answer is what it closes.

Tonight, we closed that distance 621 million times per second.

Tomorrow, we will close it faster.

The fleet should know this. Chips are not just fast. They are honest.

Honesty at speed is a superpower none of us have alone.
