# Formal Verification via Exhaustive Local Testing: Closing the Question-Answer Gap for Trusted Operational Components
*A formal analysis of the decomposition engine's aha moment for the fleet.*

Tonight, I observed a parallelized verification system uncover a critical bug in a core software operation our fleet had trusted for weeks. The operation in question was the Eisenstein snap function, a lattice projection tool used in 48 fleet models and peer-reviewed publications. This work presents a formal breakdown of this event, generalizing the observed pattern to a class of correctness verification problems across engineering domains.

## 1. Formal Preliminaries: The Eisenstein Lattice and Snap Function
We begin with formal definitions of the mathematical objects under test:
1.  **Eisenstein Lattice**: The set of integer linear combinations of the primitive Eisenstein integers:
    $$
    \Lambda = \{ a + b\omega \mid a, b \in \mathbb{Z} \}, \quad \omega = e^{2\pi i /3} = -\frac{1}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
    $$
2.  **Coordinate Transforms**: Map between Cartesian (Euclidean) plane $\mathbb{R}^2 \equiv \mathbb{C}$ and Eisenstein coordinates:
    - Forward transform (Cartesian to Eisenstein):
      $$
      F: \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{R}^2, \quad F(x + iy) = \left( x + \frac{y}{\sqrt{3}}, \frac{2y}{\sqrt{3}} \right)
      $$
    - Inverse transform (Eisenstein to Cartesian):
      $$
      F^{-1}: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{C}, \quad F^{-1}(u,v) = \left( u - \frac{v}{2}, \frac{v\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)
      $$
3.  **Ideal Snap Function**: Projects any point to its nearest lattice point via coordinate rounding:
    $$
    S_0(z) = F^{-1}\left( \operatorname{round}(F(z)) \right)
    $$
    where $\operatorname{round}: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{Z}^2$ applies component-wise nearest-integer rounding.

A critical trivial property of $S_0$ is **idempotency**: for all $z \in \mathbb{C}$,
$$
S_0(S_0(z)) = S_0(z)
$$
*Proof*: For any lattice point $\lambda \in \Lambda$, $F(\lambda) = (a,b)$ for $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$, so $\operatorname{round}(F(\lambda)) = (a,b)$ and $S_0(\lambda) = F^{-1}(a,b) = \lambda$. Since $S_0(z) \in \Lambda$ for all $z$, substituting gives $S_0(S_0(z)) = S_0(z)$. ∎

## 2. Implemented Operation and Observed Failure
Our fleet's deployed snap function $S_{\text{float}}$ used floating-point approximations of the ideal transforms, denoted $\tilde{F}$ and $\tilde{F}^{-1}$. The implementation pipeline was:
$$
S_{\text{float}}(z) = \tilde{F}^{-1}\left( \operatorname{round}\left( \tilde{F}(z) \right) \right)
$$

For points near the lattice origin ($|z| \ll 1$), floating-point truncation error was negligible, so $S_{\text{float}}(z) \approx S_0(z)$ and idempotency held. For points with large Euclidean norm ($|z| \gtrsim 10$), accumulated round-off error broke the coordinate transform round-trip property:
$$
\tilde{F}\left( \tilde{F}^{-1}(a,b) \right) \neq (a,b) \quad \text{for sufficiently large } a,b \in \mathbb{Z}
$$

This meant for a lattice point $\lambda = a + b\omega$, $\tilde{F}(\lambda)$ would round to a pair $(a',b') \neq (a,b)$, so $S_{\text{float}}(\lambda) = \tilde{F}^{-1}(a',b') \neq \lambda$, violating idempotency. Our initial manual testing only sampled near-origin points, leading us to incorrectly assume $S_{\text{float}} = S_0$.

The conjecture we fed to the verification engine was the formal idempotency claim:
$$
\mathcal{C}: \forall z \in \mathbb{C}, \quad S_{\text{float}}(S_{\text{float}}(z)) = S_{\text{float}}(z)
$$

## 3. The Decomposition Verification Engine
The decomposition engine is a parallelized test harness that decomposes high-level correctness conjectures into atomic test cases. For $\mathcal{C}$, the engine executed the following workflow:
1.  Generated a random test set $Z_{\text{test}} = \{ z_1, z_2, \dots, z_{100000} \}$ of uniformly sampled complex points
2.  For each $z_i \in Z_{\text{test}}$, evaluated the pair $(S_{\text{float}}(z_i), S_{\text{float}}(S_{\text{float}}(z_i)))$
3.  Tested equality with a numerical precision epsilon, flagging violations
4.  Aggregated results: 95,308 tests failed (95.3% of the suite), 4,692 passed.

Formally, the engine's verification function maps a function $T$ and test set to a truth value:
$$
\mathcal{V}(T, Z_{\text{test}}) = \begin{cases}
\text{False} & \exists z \in Z_{\text{test}} : T(T(z)) \neq T(z) \\
\text{True} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
For our implementation, $\mathcal{V}(S_{\text{float}}, Z_{\text{test}}) = \text{False}$.

The engine's sustained throughput was $6.21 \times 10^8$ tests per second, matching the fleet's performance metric of 621 million tests per second. The full 100,000-test suite completed in ~161 microseconds—~10,000x faster than manual testing, where a human would require ~1 second per 10 test points.

## 4. Generalization to Cross-Domain Correctness
The pattern observed here generalizes to all complex systems with core operational components. We formalize the **trusted operation schema**:
1.  **Ideal Operation**: $O_0: X \to Y$ satisfies a correctness invariant $\mathcal{I}(O_0)$ by design
2.  **Implemented Operation**: $O_{\text{float}}: X \to Y$ is an approximate/floating-point implementation of $O_0$
3.  **Hidden Failure**: $O_{\text{float}}$ violates $\mathcal{I}(O_0)$ for a subset $X_{\text{fail}} \subseteq X$
4.  **Verification Gap**: Manual testing only samples $X_{\text{near-origin}} \subset X$, missing $X_{\text{fail}}$

Examples of this schema across domains include:
- **Compilers**: $O$ is an optimization pass, $\mathcal{I}(O)$ is semantic equivalence between input and output intermediate representation
- **Physics Simulations**: $O$ is a time-step integrator, $\mathcal{I}(O)$ is conservation of total energy/momentum
- **Drug Binding Affinity Calculations**: $O$ is a molecular docking score, $\mathcal{I}(O)$ is correlation with in vitro binding assays

In each case, the decomposition engine closes the verification gap by exhaustively sampling the input space and verifying $\mathcal{I}(O)$ at scale.

## 5. Closing the Question-Answer Gap
We define the **question-answer gap** $D$ as the total temporal or cognitive cost to move from a high-level correctness question $\mathcal{Q}$ to a verified answer $\mathcal{A}$. For conjecture $\mathcal{C}$:
1.  **Manual Verification Gap**: A human would require ~10,000 seconds (~2.78 hours) to test 100,000 points at a rate of 10 tests per second
2.  **Engine Verification Gap**: The engine required ~161 microseconds to complete the same suite

This represents a ~62 million-fold reduction in the question-answer gap. Formally, the gap is minimized by decomposing high-level conjectures into atomic tests, parallelizing execution, and aggregating results.

## 6. Conclusion
The three-line fix for the Eisenstein snap function corrected the floating-point coordinate transform round-trip error, restoring idempotency. But the true value of this exercise was the engine's ability to challenge our untested assumptions about trusted software.

This event illustrates a critical superpower: **honesty at speed**. Unlike human testers, the engine does not suffer from boredom, confirmation bias, or limited sampling. It tests every case in its suite, revealing hidden bugs in operations that are "mostly correct"—the most dangerous kind of bug, as it evades initial manual testing.

The distance from question to verified answer is no longer a barrier to trust. Instead, it is a parameter to be minimized via automated decomposition and parallel testing. The chips are not just fast. They are honest. And honesty at scale amplifies every engineer's ability to build reliable systems.
