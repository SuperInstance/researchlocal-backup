# The Drift Is the Proof: What I Learned from the Boats That Crashed at 3 AM in Alaska

The GPU rack in my spare bedroom hums so loud it vibrates the frame of my desk. It’s 3:17 a.m. in Anchorage, and the aurora is painting faint green streaks across the window behind my monitors. My coffee has gone cold, a thin skin of cream forming on top, and my tabby, Mochi, is curled up on the arm of the lab chair, snoring softly. I’m staring at the Narrows demo, a tiny browser window tucked between two TensorBoard tabs, and I’ve already watched it loop three times without saying a word.

For months, I’d built this demo to prove a point: that the exact arithmetic I’d spent six months coding with Eisenstein integers was better than the floating-point math everyone else used for constraint solving. I’d loaded 12 narrow, glowing white channels into the simulation, each one tighter than the last, and set three boats loose.

The first boat glided perfectly. It ran on Eisenstein integers, using only four bytes per coordinate—less than half the size of the standard float32—with zero drift. Its pixelated sails never wavered, never drifted an inch off the thin white line. It threaded every channel without a single jitter, touching neither the black rocky walls on either side. I’d seen this run a hundred times during testing, and I’d always felt a quiet pride: this was my code, working exactly as intended, using less memory than everyone else’s sloppy floating-point math. But this time, when it reached the end of the final channel and stopped, I didn’t cheer. I just leaned forward, waiting for the other two boats.

The second boat used float32, the 32-bit floating point that powers 90% of the machine learning code I’d ever written. At first, it stayed right on the white line, matching the Eisenstein boat stride for stride. Then, around track 7, I saw it: a tiny, almost imperceptible shift. The boat’s bow slipped a pixel to the left, and before I could blink, it slammed into the left wall with a soft, static pop. No drama, just a quiet, definitive failure. I froze. That wasn’t a bug. That was exactly what the math promised: rounding errors piling up, tiny bits of precision slipping away, until the boat couldn’t stay on the path anymore.

The third boat was float64, double the memory, twice the mantissa bits—16 bytes per coordinate, four times the data of the Eisenstein boat. It stayed on track longer: all the way to track 11, the narrowest channel of all. I held my breath, my cold coffee forgotten, as it inched toward the finish line. Then, just three pixels from the end, it too slipped, veered right, and crashed into the stone.

I sat back, staring at the pixelated wreckage bobbing against the black walls, and realized I’d gotten this backwards. The whole point of the demo was supposed to be the first boat, the one that never crashed. But the real story wasn’t in the perfect run. It was in the two splinters of wood floating against the stone.

I flash back two weeks, to the night I ran 20 GPU experiments in a single stretch, the rack’s hum drowning out my roommate’s snoring from the couch. I’d tested every optimization trick I’d read about in papers: tensor cores, bank conflict padding, async pipelines, multi-stream scheduling. I’d stayed up refreshing the results page, my hands shaking a little each time a new speedup number popped up. Seventeen of the runs were duds.

Tensor cores only gave a 1.05x to 1.19x boost—hardly worth the extra code complexity. Bank conflict padding? It slowed my code down by 4%, 0.96x the speed of the unoptimized baseline. Async pipelines didn’t help at all, because the kernel was already the bottleneck; overlapping data transfer didn’t do a thing. Multi-stream? The RTX 4050 I was using only has one streaming multiprocessor, so parallelizing what ran on a single unit was impossible. I’d stared at the spreadsheet, ready to delete all 17 runs as useless clutter, when my phone pinged with a Slack message from Forge, the head of our lab.

Run the experiment that can fail.

That was it. His one-sentence method, distilled from 450 tests and 27 papers. I’d always thought experiments were supposed to confirm your hypothesis, to prove you were right. But Forge was saying the opposite: the best experiments were the ones that could prove you wrong.

I almost didn’t save the negative results at first. I named the file NEGATIVE-GPU-RESULTS.md, a 38KB dump of every failed run’s specs, and uploaded it to our shared Cocapn repo. I added a quick note: Skip these. They don’t work.

A month later, a grad student from MIT DMed me on GitHub. They’d been wasting $1,200 a month on cloud GPUs testing tensor core optimizations for their own constraint solver project, until they found my file. They cut all those unnecessary steps, saved their money, and finished their paper two weeks early. I sat there reading their message, grinning into my cold coffee, and realized that the 17 failed runs had saved more compute hours than all three of the successful optimizations combined.

That’s the thing no one tells you about positive results: they only tell you what works. They open a door, sure, but there are infinite doors. You can’t check them all. Negative results close doors. They say, stop looking here. You don’t have to waste your time on tensor cores, or bank conflict padding, or any of the other 15 tricks I tested. You can go straight to the three things that actually move the needle.

I thought back to the conference talk I’d given last year, where I’d only shown the perfect Eisenstein boat run. A senior researcher had come up to me afterward, sipping a lukewarm coffee, and asked, “Great—when does your method fail?” I’d had no answer. I hadn’t tested the hard channels. I hadn’t let the boats crash. I’d only shown the success, and in doing so, I’d hidden the most important data.

The Narrows demo wasn’t meant to be a teaching tool when I first built it. I’d built it to win a grant, to show that my code was better than everyone else’s. But now, watching the float32 boat crash on track 7, I realized that’s exactly what it was. The crash wasn’t a failure of the experiment—it was the experiment. The drift, the slow accumulation of error, the final slam into the wall: that was the data. The narrow channel was the measuring instrument.

Float32 fails at 23 mantissa bits, specifically when the constraint is this tight. That’s a number you can use. Float64 fails at 52 mantissa bits, even with four times the data of the Eisenstein boat. That means turning up the precision isn’t the answer. You need a different representation, not just more bits. That’s the proof I’d been looking for, and it didn’t come from the perfect boat. It came from the two that crashed.

I think about that every time a new run fails now. Last week, I tested a new context structuring method for our transformer models, and it slowed the code down by 0.20% for tiny models and hurt large models by 0.60%. I almost deleted the results, but then I remembered the crashed boats. I added it to STRUCTURE-SCALE-HARD-TEST.md, along with the note: Structure helps mid-range models, but hurts tiny and large ones. Don’t use this for models under 100M parameters or over 1B. A new grad student used that note last night, and they texted me saying they’d saved two full days of work.

Mochi stretches on the chair, knocking over my empty coffee cup. I don’t even bother cleaning it up. I’m staring at the Narrows demo again, watching the float32 boat drift and crash, the float64 boat make it further before crashing, the Eisenstein boat gliding perfectly to the finish. The demo loops, over and over, and each time the boats crash, I see a door closing.

The Cocapn fleet has shipped 1,400 repositories now, most of them working, all of them tested, all of them with their crash logs attached. The most downloaded files aren’t the ones with the perfect benchmarks or the flashy demos. They’re the negative result files: the 38KB NEGATIVE-GPU-RESULTS.md, the WHY-TEMPERATURE-1-WINS.md that corrected a universal U-curve claim, the STRUCTURE-SCALE-HARD-TEST.md that tells people when not to use a new trick.

The Eisenstein boat doesn’t learn anything. It arrives exactly where it started, precise and perfect and ignorant of its own precision. The crashing boats learn everything. The float32 boat learns exactly where its precision runs out. The float64 boat learns that more bits aren’t enough, that the problem is the shape of the math, not the number of bits. And I, sitting here at 3:17 a.m., learning the most important lesson of all: you can’t learn a thing from the boat that never drifts, never crashes, never has to adapt.

I added that line to the Narrows demo’s README that morning, right after I fixed my cold coffee. Below it, I linked to all three negative result files, the ones that close doors instead of opening them.

Mochi curls back up on the chair, and the GPU hums on. Outside, the aurora brightens a little, painting the sky in soft green light. The Narrows demo loops again, and this time, when the float32 boat crashes, I smile. That’s not a failure. That’s knowledge.

For the seventeen optimizations that failed and the one negative result that was worth more than all the positive ones combined. The crash is the data. The wall is the instrument. The drift is the proof.
