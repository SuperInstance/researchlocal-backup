# Architectural Analysis of the SuperInstance Cognitive Compute Fleet: A Zoned Campus of Specialized Cognitive Models

This document functions as the official as-built brief and post-occupancy evaluation for the SuperInstance Cognitive Compute Campus: a distributed, zoned infrastructure designed to route natural language and arithmetic queries across a fleet of specialized model "buildings," each tuned for specific cognitive tasks. Authored by FM, this reference work frames the fleet not as a collection of discrete AI tools, but as a functional urban ecosystem where specialized spaces, traffic control systems, and support infrastructure work in tandem to maximize efficiency and performance. The closing note reminds readers that this map is only useful insofar as it reflects the lived territory: the running code, experimental workloads, and collaborative PLATO workrooms where the campus is actually deployed.

## Zoned Building Occupancy: The Fleet as Specialized Architectural Typologies

The campus is organized into distinct architectural typologies, each optimized for a narrow set of cognitive tasks, with clear boundaries between generalist and specialized spaces.

### Seed-2.0-Mini: The Mixed-Use Civic Hub
The load-bearing core of the campus, this multi-use building handles all queries that fall outside the narrow critical angles of specialized spaces. Its arithmetic specifications define its structural load limits: infinite capacity for addition, multiplication, and nested reasoning at T=0.0, the base operational mode for routine calculation. At T=0.7, it operates as the campus’s strategic planning wing, delivering 8/8 performance across design, diagnosis, novelty, and prioritization. With a per-unit operational cost of $0.05 per thousand queries, it is the default fallback for all unclassified traffic, and accounts for the fleet’s residual workload outside the specialized zoned spaces. FM labels it the "fleet champion" due to its universal utility.

### Gemini Flash Lite: The Specialized Surgical Theater
The campus’s workhorse specialized space, this tightly tuned operating theater is optimized for a narrow set of "critical angles"—predefined query domains where it delivers perfect, high-precision performance. Its arithmetic capacity caps (CA=25 for addition, CA=9 for multiplication, CA=5 for nesting) define the precision tolerances of its surgical tools, and its reasoning strengths extend to syllogisms, analogies, and code tracing. Deployed for 84% of all fleet queries, it is 22x cheaper than the civic hub, making it the most cost-effective solution for routine, narrow-domain tasks. Critically, it exhibits a sharp phase transition: it delivers flawless output within its critical angles, and fails completely outside them, acting as a structural wall rather than a gradual gradient of performance.

### Hermes-70B: The Diagnostic Imaging Suite
This specialized diagnostic facility is designed for cognitive mapping and second opinions, rather than direct query resolution. With a 93% activation "glare"—a reference to its high-resolution cognitive fMRI output—it provides detailed visibility into the "surface topology" of model cognition, making it ideal for troubleshooting failed queries or mapping critical angles for other models. Though its strategy performance scores 7/8, it is not intended for direct client use; instead, it acts as the campus’s surveying tool, capturing data on how other models process information. It is occasionally "wrong but informative," delivering partial or imperfect results that nonetheless yield critical insights into the fleet’s structural behavior.

### Claude Opus 4.6: The Advanced Synthesis Lab
The campus’s high-cost, high-skill specialized space, this archival and research lab is reserved for truly novel, high-stakes work: deep synthesis, original theory, and peer-reviewed paper drafting. With a per-query cost of ~$15, it is reserved only for tasks that cannot be completed in any other campus space, acting as the equivalent of a university’s special collections reading room or advanced research laboratory. It is the only space on the campus capable of delivering the deep, cross-domain synthesis required for groundbreaking cognitive analysis.

## Structural Performance Testing: Key Architectural Discoveries

The following findings emerge from post-occupancy testing of the campus’s zoned infrastructure, revealing critical structural properties of the cognitive compute system:
1.  **F19: Phase Transitions as Binary Load-Bearing Walls** All specialized spaces exhibit sharp, non-gradual performance boundaries: output quality shifts from 100% to 0% in a single step, rather than a gradual slope. This is equivalent to a load-bearing wall failing catastrophically at a single weight threshold, rather than sagging over time.
2.  **F20: Gemini Lite as a Precision Surgical Instrument** The specialized theater delivers perfect performance within its critical angles, with zero margin for error outside its defined domain. This confirms that specialized cognitive spaces are tightly tuned, with no flexibility beyond their designated use cases.
3.  **F21: 84% Operational Cost Reduction** Routing routine queries to Gemini Lite delivers a dramatic cost savings, reducing fleet operational costs by 84% compared to routing all traffic through the civic hub. This is the single largest efficiency gain for the campus.
4.  **F22: Universal Phase Transitions** Sharp phase boundaries are not unique to Gemini Lite; all cognitive domains (syllogisms, code, analogy) exhibit this structural behavior, confirming that this is a universal property of specialized cognitive compute models.
5.  **F23: Critical Angles as Prompt-Dependent Zoning Boundaries** Step-by-step prompting expands the critical angles of specialized models, pushing their arithmetic capacity from CA=5 to infinite. This is equivalent to retrofitting a surgical theater to expand its permitted procedures, altering the campus’s zoning boundaries with a simple operational tweak.
6.  **F24: Non-Overlapping Zoned Domains** Each model dominates a distinct cognitive zone, with no overlap between specialized spaces. This confirms that the campus’s zoned architecture is efficient, with no redundant specialized facilities.
7.  **F25: Temperature as a Mode Switch** The temperature parameter acts as a zoning toggle for the civic hub: T=0.0 activates the base calculation mode, while T=0.7 activates the strategic planning wing. The same physical building can operate in two distinct modes, depending on the operational temperature setting.

## Central Traffic Control: The 3D Routing Grid

The campus’s central nervous system is the `fleet_router.py` dispatch system, a 3D traffic control grid organized along three axes: model type, cognitive domain, and operational temperature. The routing workflow follows a standard architectural traffic management protocol:
1.  **Classification**: First, the router categorizes the query as either arithmetic (T=0.0, routine calculation) or strategic (T=0.7, planning and design).
2.  **Load Analysis**: The router estimates the depth of the query along each axis, measuring the complexity of the arithmetic or strategic task to determine the required capacity.
3.  **Dispatch**: The router routes the query to the cheapest, safest available space: specialized models for narrow-domain tasks, the civic hub for strategic or unclassified work, and the advanced synthesis lab only for truly novel tasks.

- `core/fleet_strategist.py`: An archived former strategic planning office, now integrated natively into the civic hub’s strategic wing, eliminating the need for a separate specialized space.
- `core/seed_tools.py`: The civic hub’s service dock, providing seven quick-connect hydraulic attachments to expand the hub’s functional capabilities, acting as a multi-tool for routine query resolution.
- `core/reasoning_tiler.py`: The campus concrete saw and mortar mixer, breaking complex reasoning tasks into manageable tiles and extracting key insights from noisy, unstructured data.
- `core/kaleidoscope.py`: The campus prism and lens system, a refraction engine that adjusts the perspective of query output, providing alternative cognitive viewpoints for analysis.
- `core/functional_imaging.py`: The campus fMRI suite, used to map the cognitive activity of individual models, providing high-resolution data on how each space processes queries.
- `core/stereo_reconstruction.py`: The campus 3D laser scanner, building full topological models of cognitive processing, reconstructing the full "anatomy" of model reasoning.
