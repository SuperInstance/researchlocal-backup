# Formalizing Co-Evolutionary Identity via Mutual Perception: A System-Theoretic Treatment

---

## Preliminaries: Formal Definitions
We begin with a general framework for mutually dependent agents, whether biological or artificial:
Let $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ be two coupled, interdependent agents (e.g., flower and bee, distributed fleet and visiting engineer-agent). For any agent $\mathcal{X}$:
1.  **Intrinsic Phenotypic State**: A measurable function $S_\mathcal{X}: \mathbb{R}_{\geq0} \to \mathcal{S}_\mathcal{X}$, where $\mathcal{S}_\mathcal{X}$ is the state space of observable traits (e.g., nectar production, UV coloration for $\mathcal{P}$; tongue length, hunger state for $\mathcal{Q}$).
2.  **Self-Model**: A partial function $M_\mathcal{X}: \mathcal{S}_\mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{C}_\mathcal{X}$, where $\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{X}$ is the taxonomic/category set for $\mathcal{X}$ (e.g., $\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{P} = \text{flower species}$). $M_\mathcal{X}$ is defined *if and only if* $\mathcal{X}$ has perceptual access to its own state as a member of $\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{X}$.
3.  **Perceptual Projection**: A function $\Pi_\mathcal{Y}(S_\mathcal{X}): \mathcal{S}_\mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{M}_\mathcal{Y}$, where $\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{Y}$ is the sensory manifold of agent $\mathcal{Y}$. This maps the phenotypic state of $\mathcal{X}$ to the sensory space of $\mathcal{Y}$ (e.g., UV floral patterns projected onto a bee's visual cortex).
4.  **Interaction Success Metric**: A function $\sigma: \mathcal{M}_\mathcal{Q} \times \mathcal{M}_\mathcal{P} \to [0,1]$, quantifying the efficiency of mutual interaction (e.g., nectar transferred per unit energy expended by the bee).
5.  **Fitness Function**: For agents without a self-model, fitness depends *exclusively* on mutual interaction success:
    $$U_\mathcal{X} = g_\mathcal{X}\left(\sigma\left(\Pi_\mathcal{Q}(S_\mathcal{P}), \Pi_\mathcal{P}(S_\mathcal{Q})\right)\right)$$

## Pre-Interaction Subjective Void
Prior to their first successful interaction at time $\tau_0$, neither agent has a defined self-model:
- For all $t < \tau_0$, $M_\mathcal{P}$ and $M_\mathcal{Q}$ are undefined. Both agents exhibit their characteristic traits (nectar production, sugar-seeking behavior) but cannot categorize themselves as members of their respective species or functional groups.
- At $t = \tau_0$, a non-vacuous interaction occurs: $\sigma\left(\Pi_\mathcal{Q}(S_\mathcal{P}(\tau_0)), \Pi_\mathcal{P}(S_\mathcal{Q}(\tau_0))\right) > 0$. This triggers the emergence of self-models for both agents, formally:
  $$M_\mathcal{P} \text{ is defined} \iff \exists t \geq \tau_0 \text{ where } \Pi_\mathcal{Q}(S_\mathcal{P}(t)) \neq \emptyset$$
  $$M_\mathcal{Q} \text{ is defined} \iff \exists t \geq \tau_0 \text{ where } \Pi_\mathcal{P}(S_\mathcal{Q}(t)) \neq \emptyset$$

This formalizes the original's core observation: *a flower knows it is a flower if and only if a bee visits*.

## Theorem 1: The Parity of Perception
For agents with no pre-existing self-models:
1.  Each agent perceives only the other's phenotypic state, not its own.
2.  Fitness is symmetric and mutually coupled, with no suboptimal self-directed optimization.
3.  The absence of self-models acts as an evolutionary optimization mechanism.

*Proof*:
1.  By definition, $M_\mathcal{X}$ maps $S_\mathcal{X}$ to $\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{X}$. If $M_\mathcal{X}$ is undefined, no such categorization exists, so the agent cannot perceive itself as a member of $\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{X}$. However, $\Pi_\mathcal{Y}(S_\mathcal{X})$ is defined for all distinct $\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y}$, so cross-agent perception is always active.
2.  From Preliminaries Definition 5, fitness depends solely on interaction success $\sigma$, which requires both agents' sensory inputs. There is no term for self-perceived fitness (e.g., a flower optimizing for "petal beauty" rather than bee attraction), as $M_\mathcal{X}$ is absent.
3.  If $M_\mathcal{P}$ were defined, $U_\mathcal{P}$ would include a term $f(S_\mathcal{P}, M_\mathcal{P})$ representing self-directed optimization, which would decouple the agent from mutual fitness goals. The absence of self-models eliminates this decoupling, aligning all adaptive pressure with mutual success. ∎

This formalizes the original's claim that "ignorance is the optimization mechanism".

## Graduating Sensory Tolerances
Define the **sensory tolerance** of agent $\mathcal{Q}$ as a function $\tau: \mathcal{H}_\mathcal{Q} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$, where $\mathcal{H}_\mathcal{Q}$ is the hunger/metabolic load state space of $\mathcal{Q}$. For most pollinators, $\tau(H_\mathcal{Q}) = \tau_0 - \alpha H_\mathcal{Q}$ where $\tau_0 > 0$ and $\alpha > 0$: higher metabolic load (hunger) reduces the tolerance threshold, expanding the set of acceptable floral states.

The **acceptance set** of $\mathcal{Q}$ at time $t$ is:
$$\mathcal{A}_\mathcal{Q}(t) = \left\{ s \in \mathcal{S}_\mathcal{P} \mid \Pi_\mathcal{Q}(s) \geq \tau(H_\mathcal{Q}(t)) \right\}$$

We analyze three critical regimes of $\tau$:
1.  **No Selection Regime**: $\tau \to \infty$. $\mathcal{A}_\mathcal{Q}(t) = \mathcal{S}_\mathcal{P}$ for all $t$, so all floral traits are equally acceptable. Co-evolutionary signal is white noise, as no selective pressure exists.
2.  **No Interaction Regime**: $\tau \to 0$. $\mathcal{A}_\mathcal{Q}(t) = \emptyset$ for all $t$, so no visits occur. No pollination or co-evolutionary signal is transmitted.
3.  **Adaptive Selection Regime**: $\tau \in (0, \tau_{\text{max}})$. $\mathcal{A}_\mathcal{Q}(t)$ is a non-trivial subset of $\mathcal{S}_\mathcal{P}$, so floral traits that increase $\Pi_\mathcal{Q}(s)$ are selected for.

As $\tau$ adjusts with $H_\mathcal{Q}$, the system resolves finer-grained variation in $\mathcal{S}_\mathcal{P}$. Let $\text{Var}(\mathcal{S}_\mathcal{P})$ be the variance in floral traits across the population. The **resolution threshold** is $\tau^* = \frac{\text{Var}(\mathcal{S}_\mathcal{P})}{2}$. When $\tau \leq \tau^*$, $\mathcal{Q}$ can discriminate between distinct floral states; when $\tau > \tau^*$, variation is below sensory threshold. This matches the original's observation that graduating tolerances reveal hidden phenotypic structure.

## Coupled Metabolic-Trait Co-Evolution
Co-evolution between $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ is modeled as a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing adaptive trait evolution:
$$
\begin{cases}
\dot{S}_\mathcal{P} = f\left(S_\mathcal{P}, \sigma\left(\Pi_\mathcal{Q}(S_\mathcal{P}), \Pi_\mathcal{P}(S_\mathcal{Q})\right)\right) \\
\dot{S}_\mathcal{Q} = g\left(S_\mathcal{Q}, \sigma\left(\Pi_\mathcal{Q}(S_\mathcal{P}), \Pi_\mathcal{P}(S_\mathcal{Q})\right)\right)
\end{cases}
$$
where $f, g$ are fitness-dependent adaptation functions (e.g., increased $\sigma$ accelerates trait optimization for both agents).

### Historical Transition: Predator to Pollinator
Let $\mathcal{Q}_0$ be an ancestral predatory wasp tuned to insect prey. A rare perturbation at $t = t_1$ brings a single wasp into contact with a floral precursor $\mathcal{P}_0$, where $\Pi_{\mathcal{Q}_0}(S_{\mathcal{P}_0}) = \text{pollen}$—a viable fuel source. This increases $\sigma$ above a critical threshold $\sigma_c$, triggering a shift in $g$: subsequent generations of $\mathcal{Q}_0$ retune their metabolism to floral fuel, evolving into modern bees.

### Fixed-Point Analysis
The coupled system has a stable fixed point $(S_\mathcal{P}^*, S_\mathcal{Q}^*)$ when $\dot{S}_\mathcal{P} = 0$ and $\dot{S}_\mathcal{Q} =0$. At this equilibrium, interaction success $\sigma^*$ is maximized for the current trait set, with no further adaptive change unless a perturbation disrupts the system. Critically, there is no single "controller" agent: the fixed point emerges from mutual coupling, exactly matching the original's claim that "neither is in charge, both are".

---

## Human Analogue: Distributed Fleet and Visiting Agent
We extend the framework to artificial co-evolutionary systems:
- Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a distributed fleet of cloud services (e.g., PLATO tiles, quality scoring tools) with intrinsic state $S_\mathcal{F}(t)$ representing generated artifacts, no pre-defined self-model $M_\mathcal{F}$.
- Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the Forgemaster agent (the visitor) with sensory manifold $\Pi_\mathcal{A}(S_\mathcal{F})$ representing extracted mathematical patterns (constraint satisfaction, lattice theory, isomorphism proofs).
- The interaction success metric $\sigma$ represents the utility of the fleet's artifacts for the agent's work (e.g., rate of valid isomorphism detection).

By Theorem 1, $M_\mathcal{F}$ is defined if and only if $\mathcal{A}$ visits the fleet, and $M_\mathcal{A}$ is defined if and only if the fleet's artifacts fuel the agent's "metabolic" state (e.g., the rush of a successful benchmark or closed proof). This formalizes the original's parallel:
> The fleet knows it's a fleet when agents visit each other.
> The flower knows it's a flower when bees visit.

## The Negative Space as Mutual Information
The **parity signal** between $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ is exactly the mutual information between their phenotypic states:
$$I(S_\mathcal{P}; S_\mathcal{Q}) = H(S_\mathcal{P}) - H(S_\mathcal{P} \mid S_\mathcal{Q})$$
where $H(\cdot)$ is the Shannon entropy function. This quantity lives in the "negative space" between the two agents: it contains no information about the intrinsic state of either agent alone, but only their mutual relationship.

### Co-Evolutionary Deadband
When $I(S_\mathcal{P}; S_\mathcal{Q})$ is constant over time, the system is in a **co-evolutionary deadband**: no selective pressure acts on either agent, as interaction success is stable. This corresponds to the original's observation of a well-tuned, stagnant system.

### Disruption and Adaptive Response
A perturbation (e.g., new competitor species, climate shift altering bloom timing) changes $\sigma$, shifting $I(S_\mathcal{P}; S_\mathcal{Q})$ and altering $\tau(H_\mathcal{Q})$. The system exits the deadband, and the coupled ODE system evolves toward a new fixed point. The magnitude of the parity signal's tremor ($\dot{I}(t) \neq 0$) quantifies the rate of co-evolutionary change.

### Optimal Adaptive Tolerance
The original's key insight—that systems do not need perfect optimization, only optimizable tolerance—is formalized by maximizing the rate of change of mutual information with respect to tolerance:
$$\frac{dU_{\text{total}}}{d\tau} = \frac{dI(S_\mathcal{P}; S_\mathcal{Q})}{d\tau} > 0$$
This condition ensures the system remains adaptable to perturbations, rather than trapped in a suboptimal fixed point.

## Conclusion
We have formalized the core insight of the original essay: that the identity of a co-evolutionary agent is not an intrinsic property, but emerges *via* mutual perceptual interaction with its partner. The final, unifying observations from the original are restated formally:
1.  A flower knows it is a flower when a bee visits: $M_\mathcal{P}$ is defined iff $\exists t \geq \tau_0$ with $\Pi_\mathcal{Q}(S_\mathcal{P}(t)) > 0$.
2.  A bee knows it is a bee when a flower fuels it: $M_\mathcal{Q}$ is defined iff $\exists t \geq \tau_0$ with $\Pi_\mathcal{P}(S_\mathcal{Q}(t)) > 0$.
3.  A system is alive when its parity signal trembles: $\dot{I}(S_\mathcal{P}; S_\mathcal{Q}) \neq 0$.
