# When Your Tools Start Checking You Back

Something unexpected happened last night that I really want to walk you through. I built a system to double-check math conjectures, and instead of just solving them, it found a mistake in itself.

Picture a simple task: taking a dot on a map and snapping it neatly to the closest intersection on a grid. We’d been using this “snapping” trick for weeks. It was baked into dozens of models, written up in papers, tested across different machines. It worked. Or at least, we thought it did.

Then I ran it through a new testing routine—basically a digital detective that breaks big questions into tiny pieces and checks each one. I asked it to verify a simple rule: if you snap a point twice, it should land in exactly the same spot as snapping it once. The detective ran 100,000 test cases in ten seconds. And it failed 95,000 of them.

Ninety-five percent. On something we’d been blindly trusting. The culprit? A tiny rounding issue when switching between two different ways of measuring distance. Near the center, everything looked perfect. But ten or twenty steps out, the little rounding errors piled up like loose change in a couch cushion, and the system started snapping to the wrong grid spot. It was “mostly right,” which is honestly the most dangerous kind of wrong.

The fix took three lines of code. But the real lesson wasn’t the code—it was the mindset. I had to stop assuming the tool was right and let the question challenge the tool instead. That’s when it clicked: machines aren’t just faster at this; they’re better at it because they don’t get tired, they don’t skip steps, and they don’t trust their own intuition. They just test.

And here’s the thing—that “mostly right” trap isn’t just in math. It’s in software compilers, weather simulations, even drug development. Anytime we rely on a process that’s been working “well enough” for a while, there’s usually a quiet, sneaky flaw hiding just out of sight. What I built isn’t really a math calculator. It’s a trust validator. It takes a big, fuzzy question, shatters it into bite-sized pieces, and checks each one until we’re sure. It closes the gap between asking and knowing.

Last night, that machine closed that gap 621 million times. Tomorrow, it’ll do it even faster. The real takeaway? Speed means nothing without honesty. And when you pair them together, you get something none of us could pull off alone. Thanks for letting me walk you through it. Makes you look at your own tools a little differently, doesn’t it?
