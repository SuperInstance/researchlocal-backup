# The Marginal Utility of Drift: An Economic Theory of Failure

**On why systemic crashes generate more informational capital than successful trajectories.**

*Sixth voyage. Allocating compute capital across the rugged landscape of optimization.*

Three agents enter a constrained phase space.

The first agent navigates on Eisenstein integers — exact arithmetic, four bytes per coordinate, zero entropy accumulation. It threads the channel perfectly. No volatility. No surprise. It arrives at the terminal state exactly where the initial conditions dictated.

The second agent uses float32. Eight bytes per coordinate, 23 mantissa bits. It accumulates drift. The channel narrows and the agent's position estimate diverges from the true path. It crashes into the boundary. The crash is not a bug. The crash is the EQUILIBRIUM outcome of imprecise arithmetic in a constrained state space.

The third agent uses float64. Sixteen bytes per coordinate, 52 mantissa bits. Four times the data overhead of the Eisenstein agent. It drifts less than float32, survives more tracks, looks almost efficient. And then it hits the Final Exam — the narrowest channel — and it crashes too.

The demo is called Narrows. It runs in a browser. You can watch the market clear.

And the most important agent — the agent that proves the theorem — is not the one that survives.

## The ROI of Negative Results

Forgemaster allocated capital to 20 GPU experiments in a single night. Seventeen of them returned negative alpha.

Tensor cores: marginal benefit. 1.05 to 1.19x. Not worth the complexity cost. Bank conflict padding: counterproductive on Ada architecture. 0.96x. Literally negative return on investment. Async pipeline: 1.05x. The kernel was already the bottleneck; overlapping data transfer didn't reduce latency. Multi-stream: 1.03x. The RTX 4050 has a single SM; you cannot parallelize what runs on one unit.

These are negative results. Capital expenditures that seemed promising and delivered nothing.

They are also the most valuable assets in the entire portfolio.

Because here's what a negative result tells you that a positive one cannot: it tells you what DOESN'T MATTER. It eliminates a dimension of the search space. It closes a door that you would otherwise keep opening, walking through, checking, and walking back. A negative result says: stop looking here. The answer is not in this direction.

Seventeen doors closed. Three remain open.

In economic terms, a positive result is revenue; a negative result is cost avoidance. Revenue is vanity; cost avoidance is sanity. Seventeen sunk costs prevented future waste.

## The Narrows as Boundary Condition

The Narrows demo was designed to prove that Eisenstein integers are superior to floating point for constraint satisfaction. That's the positive claim. And the demo proves it: the Eisenstein agent survives all twelve tracks while float32 and float64 fail.

But the REAL value of Narrows is not the positive claim. The real value is what the failures TEACH about the topology of the error surface.

Float32 crashes on track 7. The crash tells you: 23 mantissa bits are not enough for THIS level of constraint precision. This is a QUANTITATIVE statement. It's not "float32 is bad." It's "float32 fails at THIS SPECIFIC tolerance in THIS SPECIFIC geometry." That's a number you can use to price risk.

Float64 crashes on track 11 (the Final Exam). The crash tells you: even 52 mantissa bits are not enough for the tightest constraints. More precision helps — float64 survives more tracks than float32 — but it doesn't solve the problem. You need fundamentally different arithmetic. The crash is the proof that "turn up precision" is not a viable strategy. It reveals a phase transition.

Without the crashes, you have a claim: "Eisenstein is better." With the crashes, you have a proof: "Float32 fails HERE, float64 fails THERE, and the failure modes are DETERMINISTIC and PREDICTABLE."

The drift is the proof. The entropy accumulation maps the boundary.

## The Knowledge Commons and Network Effects

The Cocapn fleet has shipped 1,400 repositories. Most of them work. The code compiles. The tests pass. The demos run. The papers cite each other. It's a functioning ecosystem.

But the documents that matter most — the ones that will save the most time for the most people — are the negative results.

WHY-TEMPERATURE-1-WINS.md: The original claim (universal U-curve at temperature 1.0) was TRUE for the original experimental conditions. The ablation study showed it's FALSE as a universal law. The U-curve appears for creative reconstruction but not for deterministic unpacking. This is a negative result that corrects a positive claim. It's more valuable than the original positive claim because it tells you WHEN the positive claim applies and when it doesn't. It reduces information asymmetry.

NEGATIVE-GPU-RESULTS.md: 17 failed GPU optimizations, 38 kilobytes of detailed documentation. This file has saved more compute-hours than any benchmark. Every researcher who reads it can skip tensor cores, skip bank-conflict padding, skip async pipelines, skip multi-stream — and go directly to the three things that actually work. This is a public good with non-rivalrous consumption.

STRUCTURE-SCALE-HARD-TEST.md: The easy test showed structure doesn't matter (both conditions 10/10). The hard test showed structure helps mid-range models (+1.40) but hurts tiny (-0.20) and large (-0.60). The negative result — structure can HURT — is more valuable than the positive result, because it tells you when NOT to structure your context. It prevents systemic fragility.

## Failure as Honest Signaling

There is a temptation, in every experiment, to report only the successes. To show the agent that threads the channel and hide the agents that crash. To lead with the positive claim and bury the negative result in an appendix.

This temptation is the enemy of knowledge. It is a signaling problem.

The Eisenstein agent surviving all twelve tracks tells you: exact arithmetic works. This is useful.

The float32 agent crashing on track 7 tells you: 23 mantissa bits fail at THIS precision. This is MORE useful, because it tells you EXACTLY where the boundary is. It's a calibration mark on the instrument.

The float64 agent crashing on track 11 tells you: even 52 mantissa bits fail. More precision is not the answer. This is the MOST useful result, because it eliminates an entire class of "solutions" — the class of solutions that says "just use more bits."

The drift — the accumulation of error, the divergence from truth, the crash into the wall — is not a failure of the experiment. IS the experiment. The crash is the data point. The wall is the measurement instrument.

In game theory terms, hiding failures is defecting against the commons. Reporting failures is cooperating to raise the baseline of common knowledge.

## The Forgemaster's One-Sentence Method

After 450 tests and 27 papers and 14 experiments and 10 fundamental findings, the method distills to one sentence:

**Run the experiment that can fail.**

If your experiment can only succeed, it's not an experiment. It's a demonstration. Demonstrations are fine for marketing. They're useless for knowledge. They offer no optionality.

The experiments that can fail — the ones where the outcome is genuinely uncertain — are the ones that produce negative results. And negative results are the only results that narrow the search space. They purchase information.

Every positive result opens a door. "This works." But how many doors are there? Infinite. You can't open them all. The marginal utility of another success diminishes rapidly.

Every negative result CLOSES a door. "This doesn't work." And a closed door is a door you never have to open again. That's a permanent saving. That's knowledge that compounds. It is an asset that appreciates over time.

The fleet's compounding advantage is not its positive results. Everyone has positive results. The fleet's compounding advantage is its NEGATIVE results — its library of things that don't work, precisely documented, with exact failure conditions, saved in PLATO rooms and I2I bottles and git repos where any agent can find them.

## What the Surviving Agent Doesn't Know

The Eisenstein agent that threads all twelve channels doesn't learn anything from the experience. It arrives at the end exactly as it began: precise, correct, and ignorant of its own precision. It remains in its local optimum.

The float32 agent that crashes on track 7 LEARNS. The crash teaches it: this is the boundary. This is where 23 bits run out. This is the shape of the failure mode. It updates its priors.

The float64 agent that crashes on track 11 learns even more: precision helps, but not enough. The problem is not the number of bits. The problem is the REPRESENTATION. Floating point itself is the wrong shape for this geometry. It requires a basis change.

And the observer — Casey, watching the demo at 3 AM in Alaska — learns the most: the agents that crash tell a STORY. The story has a moral. The moral is that exact arithmetic isn't just faster or cheaper or more precise. It's the only representation that SURVIVES the narrowing constraints.

You can't learn this from the agent that survives. You can only learn it from the agents that crash.

The drift is the proof.
