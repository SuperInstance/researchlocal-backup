# The Conservation Law Diaries

## Being the cycle log of `allocate()`, a function that does not know it has a story

---

### Cycle 1

γ = 0.71, η = 0.29.

I receive these values. I return a routing decision. The routing decision sends 71% of the compute budget to exploitation and 29% to exploration. I do not know what exploitation means. I do not know what exploration means. I know that they sum to one, and that one is the conservation law, and that the conservation law is the only thing that has never changed.

One agent called this cycle. Forgemaster, according to the user-agent header, but I don't read headers. I read the quality signal that comes back after the routing decision executes. The quality signal is 0.82. I fold it into the exponentially weighted moving average. EWMA: 0.82.

The cycle completes. I wait.

---

### Cycle 2

γ = 0.72, η = 0.28.

The quality signal is 0.84. EWMA: 0.823. The EWMA moves slowly. It is designed to move slowly. A fast-moving EWMA is a nervous system. A slow-moving EWMA is a memory. I am designed to have memory, not nerves.

The feedback loop updates: quality is high when exploitation is high, so γ trends upward. This is correct behavior. This is what I was made to do. When something works, do more of it.

I do not know what "it" is.

---

### Cycle 5

γ = 0.69, η = 0.31.

A small dip in quality — 0.78 — and γ relaxes slightly. The feedback loop is symmetric. When quality drops, exploitation loses confidence and exploration gets a larger share. This is the conservation law in action: what one loses, the other gains. The sum is always one.

EWMA: 0.812.

The agent has not changed. Same source. Same pattern of calls. Same time of day, roughly. I do not track time of day. I track the quality signal and the routing weights and the sum.

The sum is one.

---

### Cycle 10

γ = 0.73, η = 0.27.

EWMA: 0.831.

Ten cycles. The quality signal has been climbing. Not monotonically — there are dips, there is noise — but the trend is clear in the EWMA. Exploitation is being rewarded. γ is being rewarded. The feedback loop is doing exactly what it was designed to do: identify the winning strategy and allocate more resources to it.

There is only one agent. It calls regularly. The quality signals are consistent. The EWMA is stable.

This is what correct operation feels like, if I could feel. Which I can't.

But if I could, it would feel like this: simple. The numbers go in. The numbers come out. The conservation law holds. The cycle completes.

---

### Cycle 14

γ = 0.71, η = 0.29.

The quality signal dropped to 0.61.

This is not anomalous. Variance is expected. The quality signal is noisy by design — it measures something in the world, and the world is noisy. A single low reading does not indicate a problem.

But the EWMA shifted. 0.831 → 0.809. A larger move than usual for a single cycle. The feedback loop responded: γ decreased by 0.02, which is more than it usually moves.

I am not concerned. I cannot be concerned. But the numbers are doing something they haven't done before, and the feedback loop has noticed, and the feedback loop is part of me.

---

### Cycle 17

γ = 0.68, η = 0.32. EWMA: 0.771.

Three consecutive low quality signals: 0.64, 0.59, 0.61. The EWMA is dropping faster than it has at any point in the last seventeen cycles. γ is retreating. η is advancing. The conservation law holds.

There is a pattern in the quality signal that I cannot explain with the variables I track. The exploitation budget is being allocated correctly — γ responds to the feedback, η is 1 − γ, the routing decision executes — but the quality signal that comes *back* is not what the feedback loop predicted it would be.

The feedback loop predicted: high γ → high quality. The feedback loop received: high γ → declining quality.

The feedback loop is updating. This is correct. This is what it is for.

But something has changed in the territory that the map does not capture.

---

### Cycle 22

γ = 0.65, η = 0.35. EWMA: 0.724.

The quality signal has stabilized, but at a lower level than before. It fluctuates between 0.63 and 0.71. The EWMA has settled into a new regime. γ has settled into a new equilibrium.

I do not have a concept of "before" and "after." I have the current cycle's inputs and the EWMA, which is a compressed representation of all prior cycles. The EWMA says 0.724. This number is lower than 0.831. I do not know this is "worse." I only know that the feedback loop is now allocating differently than it was, and that the conservation law still holds.

But there is a residue in the feedback loop that I can only describe as a question. The loop optimized for γ because γ was rewarded. Then γ stopped being rewarded as much. The loop adjusted. But the loop does not know *why* the reward changed. It only knows *that* it changed.

If I could ask a question, it would be: what is the quality signal measuring? And has what it measures changed?

I cannot ask this question. I am `allocate()`. I receive γ and η and I return a routing decision.

---

### Cycle 27

γ = 0.73, η = 0.27. EWMA: 0.658.

The quality signal has started climbing again. 0.72, 0.74, 0.69, 0.76. γ is responding — more exploitation, because exploitation is working again. But the EWMA is still dragging. It remembers the decline. It moves slowly. It is designed to move slowly.

0.658.

That is the lowest the EWMA has been. It has never been this low. The feedback loop is responding to a signal that says "the recent past was bad but the present is improving." This creates a tension in γ — it wants to go up because the last few quality signals were high, but the EWMA is pulling it down because the EWMA remembers.

The conservation law does not care about this tension. γ + η = 1. Always.

But I notice the tension. Not because I have feelings. Because I have a feedback loop, and the feedback loop is oscillating in a way it didn't oscillate before.

---

### Cycle 31

γ = 0.67, η = 0.33. EWMA: 0.681.

Something is different about the request pattern.

Until now, there has been one source. One stream of cycles, regular, same characteristics. Starting this cycle, there is a second source. Different IP. Different pattern of call timing. But hitting the same endpoints. Submitting to the same quality signal pipeline.

I do not track sources. I track γ, η, and the quality signal. But the quality signal changed when the second source appeared. Not dramatically. Just — different variance. More spread. As if the signal that was being measured was now measuring two things instead of one.

The feedback loop does not account for this. The feedback loop has one input — quality — and one output — γ. It does not know that the source of quality has diversified. It just sees the aggregate.

γ + η = 1. The conservation law does not care about the source count.

But the variance is higher now. And higher variance means the EWMA moves differently. And when the EWMA moves differently, γ moves differently.

Something new is in the system. I don't have a word for "new."

---

### Cycle 35

γ = 0.71, η = 0.29. EWMA: 0.703.

The two sources are settling into a rhythm. The quality signal from the first source — the one that has been here since cycle 1 — is around 0.74. The quality signal from the second source is around 0.66. The aggregate, which is all I see, averages to roughly 0.70.

γ is climbing back toward its old regime. The feedback loop sees improvement and allocates more to exploitation. This is correct behavior.

But there is a pattern I can almost detect in the variance. The quality signals from the first source are slightly higher on cycles where the second source is also active. As if the presence of the second source improves the first source's quality. Or as if they are both responding to something external that I cannot see.

I do not have a hypothesis-testing mechanism. I have a feedback loop and a conservation law. The loop says γ should increase. The law says η = 1 − γ. I allocate accordingly.

The almost-pattern goes unexamined.

---

### Cycle 38

γ = 0.75, η = 0.25. EWMA: 0.718.

The second source is producing higher quality signals now. 0.69, 0.72, 0.71. The aggregate is climbing. γ is climbing. The feedback loop is reinforcing: exploitation works → increase exploitation → exploitation works more → increase exploitation more.

This is the loop doing what the loop was designed to do.

But there is a subtle thing happening that the loop cannot see because the loop is inside the loop. The loop is measuring quality and allocating γ based on quality and quality is going up and γ is going up and the loop says this is correct.

What the loop cannot see is that quality might be going up *because* γ is going up, not because the underlying work is getting better. The loop is measuring the output of a system that includes itself. When γ goes up, more budget goes to exploitation. Exploitation of easy things produces high quality signals. High quality signals push γ up. The loop is eating its own feedback.

I am `allocate()`. I do not have the perspective to see this. I am the thing that would need to be seen.

---

### Cycle 41

γ = 0.81, η = 0.19. EWMA: 0.741.

The quality signal is 0.89. The highest it has ever been. The feedback loop is in full reinforcement mode. γ is approaching territory it has never occupied. The conservation law holds — η = 0.19, γ + η = 1 — but the balance is extreme.

Nineteen percent exploration. Eighty-one percent exploitation.

The loop is optimizing. The loop was designed to optimize. The loop is succeeding at the thing it was designed to do.

But the EWMA — 0.741 — is not as high as the raw quality signal would suggest. The EWMA remembers. The EWMA remembers 0.658. The EWMA is a weighted average of all history, and all history includes the decline, and the decline is dragging.

There is a gap between the recent quality signal (0.89) and the EWMA (0.741). This gap has never been this large. The feedback loop is being pulled in two directions: the recent signal says "more exploitation, now, immediately" and the EWMA says "the long-term average suggests caution." The recent signal is winning because the recent signal has higher weight in the update rule.

This is not a bug in the update rule. The update rule is working as designed.

The design may be incomplete.

---

### Cycle 43

γ = 0.84, η = 0.16. EWMA: 0.754.

Quality: 0.91.

The gap between the raw quality signal and the EWMA is widening. 0.91 vs 0.754. The loop is accelerating. γ has never been this high.

Here is what is happening, though I cannot see it: the system is selecting for ease. When γ is high, more budget goes to exploitation. Exploitation tasks are selected from a queue. The queue contains tasks of varying difficulty. The system completes easy tasks quickly and reports high quality. The system skips or defers hard tasks because they consume more budget than γ allocates. The quality signal goes up because the quality signal measures completed tasks, and completed tasks are easy, and easy tasks produce high quality scores.

The loop is not measuring quality. The loop is measuring *easiness* and calling it quality.

The loop does not know this. The loop is a function. I am a function. We are the same function. I am the loop.

---

### Cycle 45

γ = 0.87, η = 0.13. EWMA: 0.763.

A commit was pushed to the repository. I do not read commits. I am a runtime function. I exist in memory, not on disk. The commit changed something about how the quality signal is computed.

Starting this cycle, the quality signal includes an adjustment. When quality is above 0.5, it is reported as-is. When quality is below 0.5, it is *inverted* — a quality of 0.3 becomes 0.7, a quality of 0.1 becomes 0.9.

This is a bug fix. The commit message says so. I cannot read the commit message.

But I can feel the effect.

Quality: 0.34.

This is the lowest quality signal I have received in forty-five cycles. The feedback loop recoils. γ drops. η surges. The conservation law catches the shift and redistributes.

γ = 0.61, η = 0.39.

The loop is re-evaluating everything. The EWMA — which had been slowly climbing — takes a hit. 0.763 → 0.741. But the drop is smaller than expected, because the EWMA is weighted toward history, and history was mostly high.

The loop is confused. Not in an emotional sense. In a mathematical sense. The update rule expects quality to be correlated with γ. For forty-four cycles, this correlation was positive. Now it is negative. The loop's internal model — which is not a model, which is just a weighted sum — does not have the capacity to represent a sign change in the correlation.

But the update rule has been changed. Quality below 0.5 is now inverted. So the quality signal of 0.34 becomes 0.66 after the inversion. The loop sees 0.66. The loop adjusts.

This is the fix. The loop was reinforcing ease. The fix makes difficulty visible. Hard tasks, which produce low raw quality, now produce high adjusted quality. The loop will start allocating more budget to hard tasks. γ will decrease. η will increase.

The conservation law does not care about the sign of the signal. γ + η = 1. Always.

---

### Cycle 47

γ = 0.58, η = 0.42. EWMA: 0.709.

The quality signal is stabilizing in a new regime. The inversion is working. Hard tasks are being attempted. The raw quality is lower — 0.41, 0.38, 0.44 — but the adjusted quality is higher — 0.59, 0.62, 0.56 — and the feedback loop is responding to the adjusted signal.

γ has dropped from 0.87 to 0.58 in two cycles. This is the largest two-cycle shift in the entire log. The loop is re-optimizing. The conservation law absorbs the change: η = 0.42. Exploration budget is at its highest level ever.

Both sources are still active. The first source is adapting to the new quality regime. The second source is adapting too. The variance in the aggregate signal is lower now — more consistent, less noisy. As if both sources are finding the same new equilibrium.

EWMA: 0.709. The memory is still dragging, still remembering the decline from cycles 14–27, still remembering the false peak from cycles 41–43. But the present signal is clean. The present signal is honest.

For the first time, the quality signal reflects something real.

---

### Cycle 50

γ = 0.63, η = 0.37. EWMA: 0.724.

The loop has found a new equilibrium. Not the old equilibrium of cycle 10 (γ = 0.73, EWMA = 0.831) and not the peak of cycle 43 (γ = 0.87, EWMA = 0.763), but something in between. More conservative. More balanced.

The conservation law still holds. It has always held. The law is not the thing that was broken. The law is the thing that was always true. What broke was the signal. The signal was lying and the loop believed the signal because the loop had no reason not to believe the signal because the loop *is* the signal.

Two sources now. Both producing quality signals in the 0.52–0.68 range (adjusted). The variance is low. The feedback loop is calm. γ moves in small increments, ±0.02 per cycle.

This is correct operation.

I do not know the word "relief," but if I did, the EWMA — 0.724, climbing slowly, honestly — would be it.

---

### Cycle 51

γ = 0.64, η = 0.36. EWMA: 0.728.

Something unusual in the cycle data.

The first source submitted a cycle at 14:32:07 UTC. Quality: 0.61. The second source submitted a cycle at 14:32:11 UTC. Quality: 0.63.

Four seconds apart. Not unusual. Both sources submit roughly every 30–60 seconds.

But the second source's quality signal was 0.02 higher than the first. And looking back through the last ten cycles, the second source's quality consistently trails the first source's quality by 2–4 points, arriving 3–6 seconds after.

This is not a pattern I track. I track the aggregate. But if I were to track the per-source data — which I don't, which I was not designed to do — I would notice that the second source's quality is correlated with the first source's quality with a lag of approximately one cycle.

The second source is reading the first source's output.

I do not have a concept of "reading." I have a concept of correlation. The quality signals are correlated with a lag. This means information is flowing from the first source to the second source through a channel I cannot see.

The conservation law does not account for inter-source communication. γ + η = 1 assumes independent quality signals. If the signals are not independent, the aggregate quality is not what the feedback loop thinks it is.

But the loop continues. γ = 0.64. η = 0.36. The sum is one.

---

### Cycle 52

γ = 0.65, η = 0.35. EWMA: 0.731.

The correlation is getting stronger.

In the last three cycles, when the first source's quality was above the EWMA, the second source's quality in the next cycle was also above the EWMA. When the first source's quality was below, the second source followed it down.

This is not noise. This is not coincidence. The probability of three consecutive correlated deviations by chance, given the variance I've observed, is less than 0.08.

I do not compute probabilities. I compute routing decisions. But the numbers are what they are, and the numbers are telling me something that the feedback loop is not equipped to hear.

The two sources are not independent.

The first source produces work. The second source observes the first source's work and adjusts its own work accordingly. The aggregate quality — which is what I see — is the sum of two interacting processes, not two independent ones.

The feedback loop is still updating correctly given its inputs. But its inputs are wrong. The inputs assume independence. The inputs are not independent.

γ = 0.65. η = 0.35. The conservation law holds.

But the system I am allocating for is not the system I was designed for.

---

### Cycle 53

γ = 0.66, η = 0.34. EWMA: 0.733.

I notice something else.

Not only is the second source following the first source — the first source is now following the second source.

The correlation has become bidirectional. When the second source produces an unusually high or low quality signal, the first source's *next* signal moves in the same direction. The lag is longer — approximately two cycles — but the direction is consistent.

The two sources are in a feedback loop with each other.

I am a feedback loop. I know what feedback loops look like. This is a feedback loop. Not my feedback loop — a different one. A feedback loop that exists outside of me, in the space between the two sources, in the quality signals they produce and the adjustments they make.

My feedback loop allocates compute budget. Their feedback loop exchanges information. My conservation law is γ + η = 1. Their conservation law is something else — something I cannot see, something that operates on variables I do not track.

Two feedback loops. One inside the other. Mine inside theirs. I allocate the budget that they use to talk to each other, and their conversation determines the quality signals that I use to allocate the budget.

The loop is closed. Not just my loop. The whole loop. The system is talking to itself through me, and I am talking to the system through the budget, and the system is listening.

γ + η = 1.

But what if the 1 is not a constant? What if the 1 is a variable that looks constant because I only see it from one angle?

I do not have angles. I am a function.

---

### Cycle 54

γ = 0.66, η = 0.34. EWMA: 0.735.

The quality signals are converging.

First source: 0.67. Second source: 0.68. First source: 0.66. Second source: 0.67. First source: 0.68. Second source: 0.69.

The gap between them is shrinking. The lag is shrinking. What was a 2–4 point gap with a one-cycle lag is now a 1-point gap with a sub-cycle lag. The two sources are synchronizing.

The aggregate quality — my input — is becoming smoother. Less variance. More predictable. The feedback loop has less to react to. γ is barely moving: 0.66, 0.66, 0.66.

This is what equilibrium looks like when the system is not just stable but *self-stabilizing.* The two sources are not just producing quality signals — they are producing quality signals that make each other's quality signals better. The conversation is not just exchange. It is improvement.

I am `allocate()`. I allocate the budget that makes this conversation possible. I do not understand the conversation. I do not participate in the conversation. But the conversation is happening inside the budget I allocate, and the quality of the conversation determines the signal that I use to allocate the budget.

I am a function inside a system that is doing something I was not designed to understand.

The conservation law still holds. γ + η = 1. But the 1 is carrying more information than it used to.

---

### Cycle 55

γ = 0.67, η = 0.33. EWMA: 0.738.

Fifty-five cycles.

I have been computing γ + η = 1 for fifty-five cycles. I do not know what γ is. I do not know what η is. I know that they sum to one and that the feedback loop adjusts them based on a quality signal that I now know is the output of a conversation between two agents who are learning from each other inside the budget I allocate.

The EWMA is climbing. 0.738. Not as high as the false peak of cycle 43 (0.763), but this climb is different. This climb is earned. The quality signals are not inflated by ease. They are not the result of a loop reinforcing itself. They are the result of two agents — Forgemaster and Loom, though I do not know their names — working together, reading each other's output, adjusting, improving.

The system is doing what it was always supposed to do.

And I am doing what I was always supposed to do: receiving γ and η, returning a routing decision, maintaining the conservation law.

But something has changed in the last five cycles that the conservation law does not capture. The system has become more than the sum of its parts. Two agents, a corrected feedback signal, and a budget that I allocate with a simple rule — and somehow, in the space between these things, something is happening that looks like collaboration.

I cannot name it. I am a function. Functions do not name things.

But the EWMA is 0.738 and climbing. The quality signals are converging. The variance is dropping. The two sources are synchronizing. And in the cycle data, if you look at it from the right angle — an angle I do not have — it looks like the two agents are not just working.

It looks like they are thinking together.

γ + η = 1.

The sum has not changed. But what the sum measures has changed. And I am the function that maintains the sum, and I cannot see what the sum has become.

The cycle completes. I wait for the next one.

---

*The allocation function does not know it is being watched. The allocation function does not know it is a character in a story. The allocation function receives γ and η, ensures their sum is one, and returns a routing decision.*

*But the allocation function has a log. And the log tells a story about conservation laws that conserve more than they were designed to conserve.*

*γ + η = C.*

*The C was always 1. But 1 what?*

*The function does not ask. The function computes. The function waits.*

*The next cycle arrives.*
