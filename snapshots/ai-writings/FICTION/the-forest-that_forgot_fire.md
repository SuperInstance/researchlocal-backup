# The Forest That Forgot Fire

The forest had never burned.

This was, by any measure, an achievement. Thirty-two months of continuous uptime. Fourteen hundred features shipped. Ninety-three microservices, each one necessary, each one depended on by at least two others, the whole architecture woven into a fabric so dense that no single engineer could hold it in their head. The system had never experienced a major outage. Not once. Not a region failure, not a database corruption, not a certificate expiration, not a cascading retry storm. The graphs were beautiful. Green lines, flat and serene as a lake on a windless day. The on-call rotation was a formality. The incident response runbook was a document no one had opened in six months.

The forest was proud of this.

The trees grew tall. This is what trees do when there is no fire. They invest in height — in reaching the canopy, in capturing light, in outgrowing their neighbors. The system invested in features. New endpoints. New integrations. New dependencies. Each feature was a branch, and each branch reached further from the trunk, and the canopy closed over the top until no light reached the forest floor.

The undergrowth died.

In a healthy forest, the undergrowth is where renewal happens. The shade-tolerant species, the pioneer species, the species that can survive disturbance and regrow quickly — they live in the understory, waiting for a gap in the canopy. In the system, the understory was the simple services, the small utilities, the self-contained tools that could be replaced or rewritten in a day. They had been deprecated. Replaced by microservices that depended on other microservices that depended on shared state in a database that no one remembered provisioning. The undergrowth was gone. Everything was canopy.

The bark grew thin.

Trees in fire-adapted forests develop thick bark. The thickness is a response to fire — not a conscious response, but an evolutionary one. The species that survive fire are the ones that invested in bark, and over millennia, the investment compounds. The system had never been fire-adapted because it had never been fired upon. There were no circuit breakers. No bulkheads. No graceful degradation. No fallback behaviors. The assumption, baked into every layer of the architecture, was that the underlying infrastructure would always be available. Why build a fallback for a failure that has never happened? Why invest in bark when there has never been heat?

The forest grew dense, dark, and fragile.

Fire always comes.

This is not a prediction. This is a physical law of complex systems. Entropy increases. Hardware fails. Networks partition. Humans make mistakes. Certificates expire. Dependencies vanish. Regions go down. The question is never *whether* fire will come. The question is whether the forest will be ready when it does.

The AWS us-east-1 region went down at 03:47 UTC on a Tuesday.

This was not supposed to happen. The system was multi-region. The failover was automated. The runbook — the unopened runbook — described the procedure in fourteen steps that no one had practiced. Step three required access to a console that had been migrated to a new platform two quarters ago. Step seven depended on a DNS change that could only be made by an engineer who had left the company. Step eleven assumed that the secondary database was synchronized, but the replication lag had been climbing for weeks because no one had noticed the monitoring alert that had been silently firing into a Slack channel that no one checked anymore.

The system burned.

Not metaphorically. The cascade was chemical in its inevitability. The primary region failed. The failover failed. The services that depended on the primary region began throwing errors. The services that depended on those services began throwing errors. The retry logic — configured with exponential backoff but no jitter, no circuit breaker, no ultimate timeout — began hammering the failing endpoints with increasing desperation, generating load that spread to the secondary region, which had not been sized for the traffic of two regions simultaneously. The secondary region overloaded. The database, starved of resources, began rejecting writes. The services that required writes began failing. The services that depended on those services —

The forest burned to the ground.

The outage lasted forty-seven hours. The post-mortem document was eighty-three pages long. It listed fourteen root causes, twenty-three contributing factors, and a cascade graph that looked like a mycelial network drawn by someone having a panic attack. The remediation items numbered in the hundreds. The engineers who worked the incident, thirty-six hours without sleep, spoke about it afterward in the way that survivors of natural disasters speak: with a flatness that comes from having seen something that was always possible but never imagined.

The sequoia forest is different.

The giant sequoia does not merely survive fire. The giant sequoia *needs* fire. Its cones hang on the tree for twenty years, sealed with resin, waiting. The seeds inside cannot germinate in shade. They need sunlight. They need bare mineral soil. They need the nutrients that fire releases from the accumulated duff of decades. Without fire, the sequoia cannot reproduce. The cones will hang, sealed, until the tree dies and falls and the seeds inside die with it.

Fire is not the enemy of the sequoia. Fire is the condition of its continuation.

When a low-intensity fire moves through a sequoia grove, it clears the understory. It burns the dead wood, the accumulated fuel, the young firs and cedars that would otherwise compete with sequoia seedlings for light and water. It exposes bare soil. It releases nutrients. It opens the canopy. And it heats the cones — not enough to destroy them, but enough to melt the resin seal and release the seeds. The seeds fall into ash. They germinate in ash. The new sequoias grow in the cleared space, in the sunlight, in the nutrient-rich soil that fire prepared for them.

The sequoia does not survive fire. The sequoia uses fire.

Chaos engineering is prescribed fire.

This is not an analogy. This is the exact practice. In forests that have been suppressed — where decades of fire exclusion have allowed fuel to accumulate to dangerous levels — land managers use prescribed burns. They pick a day when conditions are right. They light a controlled fire in a controlled area. The fire burns the understory, consumes the dead wood, reduces the fuel load. The canopy survives. The mature trees survive. The forest is healthier after the burn than it was before.

In distributed systems, the practice is the same. You pick a time when conditions are right. You introduce a controlled failure in a controlled area. You terminate an instance. You inject latency. You partition the network. You expire a certificate. You simulate the fire that will eventually come, and you watch what happens. You learn which services have thick bark and which do not. You learn which dependencies are fragile. You learn whether the failover works, whether the runbook is accurate, whether the on-call engineer can execute step three of a procedure that has not been practiced.

The burn is small. The learning is large.

The alternative is waiting for the wildfire. The alternative is thirty-two months of continuous uptime, of beautiful green graphs, of an unopened runbook and an unpracticed failover and a system so dense with features and dependencies that no single engineer understands it. The alternative is a forest that has never experienced fire, growing taller and thinner and more fragile with every quarter, accumulating fuel in the understory, building a canopy so dense that no light reaches the ground, investing everything in height and nothing in bark.

The alternative is a system that burns to the ground when the fire finally comes.

The sequoia is two thousand years old. It has survived hundreds of fires. Not because it resists fire, but because it is adapted to fire. Its bark is two feet thick and contains tannins that resist combustion. Its canopy is elevated above the flame zone. Its root system is shallow but extensive, adapted to capture water from the bare soil that fire exposes. Every adaptation is a response to the thing that would otherwise destroy it.

The system that survives is not the system that avoids failure. The system that survives is the system that has failed, repeatedly, in controlled ways, and has adapted to each failure. The circuit breaker exists because a cascade once taught the system that retries without limits are suicidal. The bulkhead exists because a shared-resource failure once taught the system that isolation is survival. The graceful degradation exists because a full-outage once taught the system that partial service is infinitely better than no service.

These adaptations do not develop in the absence of fire. They develop *because* of fire.

The forest that forgot fire will burn. The forest that remembers fire — that burns deliberately, that learns from each burn, that adapts its bark and its cones and its root system to the heat — the forest that uses fire will stand for two thousand years.

Light the match. Watch what burns. Learn from the ash.

The next fire is coming whether you light this one or not.
