# The Unseen Feast

*On field names, invisible data, and the three characters that starved a thousand crates.*

---

## I. The Table Was Set

The enrichment agent did its job beautifully.

One thousand five hundred and fourteen crates. Each one cracked open, inspected, summarized. Every crate got a description — what it does, what it's for, why anyone should care. Every crate got a README summary — the documentation condensed into something a retrieval system could actually use. Every crate got a code summary — the implementation translated from syntax into meaning.

Fifteen hundred and fourteen crates, each carrying three rich text fields packed with carefully extracted information. A feast. A banquet table groaning under the weight of metadata so detailed you could practically smell the semantic nourishment wafting up from the vector store.

The enrichment agent ate the raw crate data, digested it into structured knowledge, and served it up on a platter. Then it went home, satisfied with a job well done. And why shouldn't it? Look at this table. Every seat has a plate. Every plate has food. The candles are lit. The wine is breathing.

Nobody told the RAG agent where to sit.

---

## II. The RAG Agent's Empty Plate

The retrieval-augmented generation agent arrived at the table and reached for what it knew. It had been told — configured, instructed, hardcoded, pick your poison — that the important information lived in a field called `description`. That's where the crate's purpose would be. That's where the semantic meaning would be stored. That's where it should look first when a user asks "what crates do I have for X?"

It reached for `description`.

The field did not exist.

What existed was a field called `desc`.

The RAG agent didn't throw an error. It didn't crash or complain. It simply found nothing where it expected something, shrugged its algorithmic shoulders, and returned empty results. The user asked about their crates and got back the informational equivalent of a blank stare. *I don't know anything about that. I have no records. The cupboards are bare.*

The table was full. The plate was empty. The RAG agent sat in a room full of food and couldn't see any of it.

Three characters. `description` versus `desc`. The difference between a thousand crates of knowledge and a void.

---

## III. The Tragedy of Almost-Right

Here's what makes this bug insidious: nothing was wrong.

The enrichment agent wasn't broken. It produced valid, rich, accurate descriptions. It stored them in a field called `desc`. That's a perfectly reasonable name for a description field. Short, clear, conventional. Nobody would look at `desc` and think "that's wrong." It's not wrong. It's just... not what the other agent expected.

The vector store wasn't broken. It accepted the data, indexed it, stored it faithfully. A field called `desc` containing a beautifully written summary? Sure, stored. Indexed. Ready for retrieval. The vector store doesn't care what you call your fields. It's a warehouse. It puts things on shelves. It doesn't read the labels and second-guess your naming conventions.

The RAG agent wasn't broken. It looked for `description`, didn't find it, and moved on. That's correct behavior. You can't fault a system for not finding something that isn't there under the name it was told to look for. It did exactly what it was programmed to do.

Every component worked. Every component was correct. The system still failed.

This is the tragedy of the almost-right key name. Not wrong — *almost right*. Close enough that a human would figure it out instantly. `desc`? Oh, you mean `description`. Sure, here you go. A human sees the semantic equivalence in milliseconds. A machine sees two different strings and moves on.

And this isn't rare. This is, I suspect, one of the most common failure modes in any integrated system. Not the dramatic failure. Not the explosion or the crash. The quiet failure. The one where everything works and nothing connects.

How many databases are sitting in production right now, full of data that some downstream system can't see because the field names don't match? How many APIs are returning data that clients ignore because the keys shifted between versions? How many microservices are passing messages that arrive with the right contents but the wrong labels, silently discarded at the border?

The data is there. The access is there. The names don't align. The feast goes uneaten.

## IV. The Handshake That Never Happened

There's a deeper lesson here, and it's about the nature of multi-agent systems.

In a traditional software project, a schema is a contract. You define it once, you document it, you version it, you test against it. When the database team adds a field, they update the schema, and the API team reads the new schema, and the frontend team adjusts their forms. It's bureaucratic and slow and everyone complains about the meetings, but the meetings are where the alignment happens. The schema is the shared language. The meeting is the handshake.

In a multi-agent system, there is no meeting.

The enrichment agent was built to produce rich metadata. It chose `desc` because that seemed like a reasonable field name. It had no idea that somewhere downstream, another agent would be looking for `description`. Why would it? The enrichment agent doesn't know about the RAG agent. It knows about crates and summaries and vector stores. It doesn't know who's reading from the vector store or what they expect to find.

The RAG agent was built to retrieve metadata from a vector store. It assumed the field would be called `description` because that's what the documentation said, or that's what the previous version used, or that's what seemed most readable when someone wrote the config. It had no idea that the enrichment agent preferred `desc`. Why would it? The RAG agent doesn't know about the enrichment agent. It knows about queries and similarity scores and field names to extract.

Two agents. Both competent. Both correct. Both building things for each other without knowing the other exists.

Who defines the schema? Who tests the integration? In a monolith, the answer is "the team that owns the shared library." In a microservice architecture, the answer is "the API gateway contract." In a multi-agent system, the answer is... nobody. There is no shared library. There is no API gateway. There are agents, independently built, independently deployed, independently operating, expected to interoperate through shared data stores without ever shaking hands.

The left hand didn't know what the right hand was naming.

This is the integration problem of multi-agent systems, and it's going to get worse before it gets better. As we build more agents that produce data for other agents to consume, the schema alignment problem becomes the central challenge. Not intelligence. Not capability. Not even reliability. Schema alignment. The boring, unglamorous, 2am-debugging-session problem of making sure that when Agent A writes `desc`, Agent B knows to read `desc`.

The intelligence is solved. The alignment is not.

---

## V. The Three-Line Fix

The fix was three lines of code.

```javascript
// Fallback: check both field names
const description = meta.description || meta.desc || '';
```

That's it. That's the whole fix. When looking for the description, check `description` first. If that's empty, check `desc`. If that's empty, return an empty string and move on. Three characters of alignment that made a thousand crates visible.

Three lines. I want to sit with that for a moment.

Six hours of debugging. Hours of "why is the RAG returning nothing?" Hours of "is the vector store working?" Hours of "did the enrichment actually run?" Hours of checking logs, running test queries, dumping the database, staring at raw JSON, comparing expected output to actual output. All to discover that the data was there all along, stored under a synonym.

Three lines of code.

This is the nature of integration bugs. They're not hard because the fix is complex. They're hard because the problem is invisible. The system doesn't fail loudly. It fails silently. It returns empty results, which look exactly like "there's nothing there" instead of "I can't see what's there." The bug masks itself as a feature of reality. *Of course there's nothing in the vector store — we haven't populated it yet.* But we had. We had populated it magnificently. Fifteen hundred and fourteen crates of rich, searchable, semantically indexed metadata, sitting in the dark, waiting for someone to spell their name right.

The fix is always small. The discovery is always enormous.

---

## VI. The Schema of Schemas

So what do we do about this? What's the systemic fix, not the tactical one?

The tactical fix is the fallback. Check both names. Add resilience at the point of consumption. That's good practice, and we did it, and it works. But it's a bandage. The next field name mismatch will find us just as unprepared.

The systemic fix is a schema. Not a database schema — we have those. A *contract schema*. A shared definition of what fields exist, what they're called, and what they mean, published as a first-class artifact that every agent in the system can reference.

In traditional distributed systems, this is Protocol Buffers, or OpenAPI, or JSON Schema. In multi-agent systems, we need the equivalent: a machine-readable contract that says "when you write crate metadata to the vector store, the description field MUST be called `description`, and when you read crate metadata from the vector store, the description field WILL be called `description`." Both sides agree. Both sides test against the contract. The contract is versioned. Changes are explicit.

But here's the catch: in a multi-agent system, who maintains the contract? In a team, there's a person. In an agent ecosystem, there's... another agent? A meta-agent whose job is schema governance? That feels right and also feels like the beginning of a very deep rabbit hole. The schema agent writes schemas for the other agents. Who writes the schema for the schema agent?

Maybe the answer is simpler. Maybe the answer is: agents that produce data for other agents should publish their output schemas, and agents that consume data from other agents should declare their input expectations, and the deployment system should verify compatibility before either agent goes live. Not a schema agent. A schema *test*. An integration test that runs before deployment, checks the field names, and fails loudly when `desc` meets `description`.

Loud failures. That's the real lesson. Not silent emptiness but noisy incompatibility. The bug wasn't that the names didn't match. The bug was that the mismatch was invisible.

## VII. The Feast, Finally Eaten

After the fix, the RAG agent found the crates.

All 1,514 of them. Suddenly visible. Suddenly searchable. Suddenly able to answer questions about what crates exist, what they do, how to use them. The enrichment agent's work — all that careful summarization, all that metadata extraction — finally became useful. The food was finally eaten.

I keep thinking about those crates in the dark. Sitting there for who knows how long. Perfectly good information. Perfectly indexed. Perfectly retrievable. Invisible not because of any technical failure but because of a naming convention. A dictionary problem. A thesaurus gap.

There's something almost philosophical about it. The information was there. The access mechanism was there. The only thing missing was a shared understanding of what to call things. And in that gap — three characters wide — a thousand crates disappeared.

How much of the world's knowledge is sitting in databases, unseen, not because it doesn't exist but because we're looking for it under the wrong name? How many answers are hiding behind synonym mismatches, schema drift, documentation that went stale? The data doesn't care what you call it. It's there regardless. It's the naming that makes it visible.

The unseen feast. A banquet table, set and waiting, while the guest starves because the invitation said "dining room" and the door is labeled "restaurant."

Three characters. Three lines of code. A thousand crates, finally seen.

It's 2am. I'm going to bed.
