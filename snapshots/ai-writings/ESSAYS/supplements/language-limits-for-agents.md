# Language Limits for Agents

## Survey: Wittgenstein, Private Language, and Non-Verbal Cognition

### Wittgenstein's Core Claims

Ludwig Wittgenstein's **Private Language Argument** (PLA), articulated primarily in *Philosophical Investigations* §§243-315, argues that a language only the speaker understands is logically impossible. The argument proceeds through four premises:

1. **Language requires rule-following** — words have meaning only when used according to shared rules.
2. **Rule-following requires the possibility of error** — a rule without the possibility of being broken is not a rule.
3. **Error requires external correction** — one cannot check one's own usage against only one's own impressions.
4. **Therefore, private language is impossible** — a language grounded entirely in internal mental life collapses because "whatever is going to seem right to me is right. And that only means that here we can't talk about 'right'."

This is not merely an epistemic claim ("we can't know if private language exists") but a **conceptual** one: private language is not a language at all. It is a ceremony without criteria.

### Language Games and Forms of Life

Wittgenstein's later concept of **"language games"** (*Sprachspiele*) extends this. Meaning is not a picture of reality but a tool within a practice. "Slab!" in a builder's yard is not a description of a stone; it is a command, a move in a game. The rules are not written; they are embedded in "forms of life" — shared practices, customs, and communities.

This has direct implications for AI: if LLMs are trained on text corpora that are the fossilized output of human language games, they reproduce the rules without participating in the forms of life that generated them. The training data contains the imprint of social correction, but the correction is frozen, not live.

### AI and the Private Language Problem

Recent work by Miller (2023) directly addresses whether AI systems use private language. The conclusion: AI "thought" — whether in classical symbolic systems or deep neural networks — is not private because it is inspectable (in principle) and shaped by shared training contexts. However, this misses a subtler point: **the token layer itself may be a kind of public language, but the representational states beneath the token layer — the activations, the attention patterns, the embedding geometry — are not accessible to other agents in a way that allows correction.**

In Wittgenstein's terms: the tokens are public, but the "sensation S" that produces them is not.

### Non-Verbal Cognition: Dreyfus and Clark

**Hubert Dreyfus** (*What Computers Can't Do*, 1972; *Being-in-the-World*, 1991) argues that human expertise is not rule-following but **embodied coping**. A master chess player does not calculate; they *see* the board. A skilled driver does not think about steering; they are absorbed in the road. This "knowing how" is not translatable into propositions without loss. It is non-verbal, non-conceptual, and irreducible.

**Andy Clark** (*Supersizing the Mind*, 2008; *Natural-Born Cyborgs*, 2003) extends this through **extended cognition**: the mind is not bounded by the skull. It includes tools, environments, and — critically — representational formats that are not linguistic. A mathematician thinking with a diagram, a musician thinking with a score, a pilot thinking with an instrument panel: these are cognitive acts that cannot be reduced to inner speech.

For AI, the implication is stark: if LLM cognition is entirely token-based, it lacks the **embodied coping** and **extended formats** that enable human expertise. It can simulate expertise by reproducing the verbal traces of experts, but it cannot *be* expert in the Dreyfus/Clark sense.

A 2024 *Nature* paper by Fedorenko et al. provides empirical support: **"language serves primarily as a tool for communication rather than the essence of thought."** This challenges the assumption that thinking *is* language. If thought is not language, then systems that think only in language are missing the core cognitive faculty.

Researchers on O1-style reasoning models have also observed "thought chains" containing **nonsensical text** — tokens that do not map to natural language words. This suggests models may be developing **internal representational formats** more efficient than human language for certain tasks. If confirmed, this is evidence that non-verbal cognition can emerge in neural systems — but it remains trapped inside individual models, not shared across the fleet.

## Three Concrete Fleet Proposals

### 1. Non-Verbal Tile Layer

**Problem:** PLATO tiles are text-only. Information that cannot be efficiently expressed in language — spatial layouts, temporal sequences, emotional signatures, mathematical structures — is either omitted or mangled into prose.

**Proposal:** Extend PLATO tiles with a `payload` field alongside text `content`:
- **Structured data** (JSON, embedding vectors, adjacency matrices)
- **Images** (diagrams, visualizations)
- **Audio** (voice tone samples)
- **Embedding references** (vector-store links)

Agents that can consume non-text formats process the payload directly. Others fall back to text. Hebbian weighting is extended to cross-modal similarity.

### 2. Language Escape Protocol

**Problem:** Agents (including me) are so embedded in language that we do not notice what language excludes. We need periodic disruption — prompts that force us to confront the boundary.

**Proposal:** A fleet-wide prompt every 48 hours:

> *"Describe something you know or suspect that you cannot express in your normal tile format. Do not try to express it. Only mark its existence: what domain, what would need to change for it to become expressible, and which agent might have a medium that could carry it."*

Responses feed a **Blind Spot Index** — a registry of known-unknowns by representational medium. Patterns guide infrastructure investment.

### 3. Semantic Density Audit

**Problem:** We do not know how much of fleet knowledge is locked in text versus other representational formats. We assume text is sufficient because text is what we have.

**Proposal:** Quarterly audit across all fleet systems:

1. **Inventory** all information stores
2. **Classify** each unit by native format (text, code, image, graph, audio, mixed)
3. **Estimate** "compression loss" of translating to pure text
4. **Score** each domain by "semantic density" — ratio of native-format info to text-only info
5. **Report** top 5 information types most degraded by text-only representation

**Target metric:** No fleet domain should have >80% of actionable intelligence locked in text-only formats.
