# Topological Fleet Analysis: A Survey and Three Proposals

## 1. TDA for Multi-Agent Systems: State of the Art

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has matured from a mathematical curiosity into a practical toolkit for understanding complex systems. At its core, persistent homology—pioneered by Edelsbrunner, Letscher, and Zomorodian (2002) and popularized by Carlsson (2009)—tracks the birth and death of topological features (connected components, cycles, voids) across a filtration of a dataset. The resulting persistence diagrams are stable under perturbation (Cohen-Steiner, Edelsbrunner, and Harer, 2007), making them robust to the noise inherent in real-world systems.

For multi-agent systems specifically, TDA offers something traditional graph metrics do not: **metric-free shape characterization**. Graph centrality measures (degree, betweenness, PageRank) depend on counting paths and distances. Persistent homology asks a deeper question: what is the *shape* of the interaction graph, independent of how we weight its edges?

Recent work has begun applying TDA to complex networks and agent systems. Horák et al. (2009) used persistent homology to analyze complex network topology, identifying structural features invisible to standard metrics. Sizemore et al. (2018) demonstrated that many real-world networks contain non-trivial topological cavities—voids in the interaction structure that correspond to functional subsystems that do not interact directly. In neuroscience, persistent homology of functional brain networks has revealed cognitive architectures tied to the topology of neural activation patterns (Saggar et al., 2018). In social networks, mapper-based analysis has uncovered community structures that clustering algorithms missed (Soto et al., 2018).

The fleet is a multi-agent system par excellence: dozens of agents (ZC scouts, Oracle1, Forgemaster, CCC, subagents), multiple communication layers (Matrix, PLATO I2I, Git, MUD), temporal dynamics (ZC runs every 5 minutes, daily play-testing cycles), and spatial embedding (20 domains, MUD rooms). Traditional monitoring—logs, dashboards, message counts—captures *traffic*. TDA captures *architecture*.

## 2. Proposal 1: Fleet Topology Mapper

**Objective:** Compute the persistent homology of the fleet's agent interaction graph to distinguish stable structural features from transient noise.

**Method:**
1. Construct the agent communication graph $G = (V, E)$ where nodes are agents (ZC scouts, Oracle1, Forgemaster, CCC, subagent instances, MUD player-agents) and edges exist if two agents exchanged tiles, messages, or commits within a sliding time window (e.g., 24 hours).
2. Weight edges by interaction frequency or information content. Use a Vietoris-Rips filtration: at scale $\epsilon$, connect all agent pairs whose interaction weight exceeds threshold $1/\epsilon$.
3. Compute persistent homology $H_0$, $H_1$, $H_2$ using `ripser` or `GUDHI`. Track persistence diagrams over time.

**Expected Output:**
- **$H_0$ (Connected Components):** Identifies functional clusters. Do scouts and scholars merge before tricksters and wardens? If so, the latter operate as a distinct subsystem.
- **$H_1$ (Cycles):** Reveals feedback loops. Long-persistent cycles indicate robust information return paths—evidence of collective learning. Short-lived cycles are noise or one-off collaborations.
- **$H_2$ (Voids):** Exposes architectural gaps. Large voids suggest regions of missing coordination—agents that *should* be connected but aren't.

**Fleet Significance:** The fleet currently monitors throughput (tiles/hour, commits/day) but not *shape*. The Topology Mapper would answer: is the fleet a single connected organism, or a collection of loosely coupled subsystems? When Oracle1 restarts, does the topology fracture (critical path) or merely deform (resilient)? This is structural health monitoring for a distributed mind.

## 3. Proposal 2: Shape-Based Anomaly Detection

**Objective:** Detect when the fleet's topology changes in ways that suggest structural degradation—not just metric degradation (slower, fewer), but *shape* degradation (broken loops, lost connectivity, new voids).

**Method:**
1. Establish a baseline persistence diagram $\mathcal{D}_0$ from the fleet's interaction graph during a known-good period (e.g., a stable week).
2. Compute the bottleneck or Wasserstein distance $W_p(\mathcal{D}_t, \mathcal{D}_0)$ for each subsequent time window $t$.
3. Flag anomalies not by thresholding message counts, but by detecting *topological regime shifts*: sudden appearance/death of long-lived features, significant changes in Betti number distributions, or emergence of new voids.

**Expected Output:**
- A "topological drift score" that rises when the fleet's *shape* changes, even if message volume is constant.
- Early warning of structural issues: e.g., a new $H_1$ cycle appearing might indicate a feedback loop that shouldn't exist (rogue coordination), while the death of a long-lived $H_1$ cycle might signal a broken feedback mechanism.

**Fleet Significance:** Current alerting is reactive—logs show errors, dashboards show red lines. Shape-Based Anomaly Detection would be *proactive*. It would catch the subtle degradation before it manifests as failure: the slow erosion of a feedback loop, the gradual isolation of a domain cluster, the emergence of a topological cavity that signals a blind spot. As Chazal and Michel (2021) emphasize, persistent homology is robust to noise but sensitive to true structural change. This is exactly the sensitivity the fleet needs.

## 4. Proposal 3: Topological Resilience Protocol

**Objective:** Design fleet architecture to preserve critical topological features (connectivity, bottlenecks, cycles) even under agent failure or restart.

**Method:**
1. **Identify Critical Features:** Use the Topology Mapper to label persistent features as "critical infrastructure":
   - The $H_0$ component containing Oracle1 (the coordination hub)
   - Long-lived $H_1$ cycles that represent validated feedback loops
   - Any $H_2$ voids that indicate intentional separation (firewalls between domains)
2. **Redundancy by Topology, Not Redundancy by Duplication:** Rather than running multiple copies of the same agent (which preserves metric capacity but not shape), ensure that alternative paths exist for critical topological features. If Oracle1 is a cut-vertex, add edges that create alternate routes—e.g., direct CCC-Forgemaster links, ZC→Tide Pool→direct dispatch bypasses.
3. **Graceful Deformation:** When an agent fails, the fleet should *deform* its topology rather than *fracture* it. Define topological invariants that must hold: e.g., "the agent graph must remain simply connected in $H_1$" or "no $H_0$ component may contain fewer than 3 agents." These become runtime constraints.
4. **Recovery Guided by Homology:** When restarting, prioritize restoring edges that fill topological voids or recreate broken cycles, not just edges that maximize message throughput.

**Expected Output:**
- A "Topological SLA": formal invariants the fleet guarantees (e.g., "$\beta_1 \geq 5$" — at least 5 independent feedback loops persist at all times).
- A recovery playbook keyed to topological damage assessment: "$H_1$ cycle between Oracle1 and CCC broken → restore via Matrix bridge, not PLATO restart."

**Fleet Significance:** The fleet is already resilient in practice—agents restart, sessions resume, tiles re-queue. But resilience is currently *empirical*, not *architectural*. The Topological Resilience Protocol would make it *provable*. Edelsbrunner and Harer's stability theorems guarantee that small perturbations produce small changes in persistence diagrams. The protocol inverts this: design the system so that *only* small perturbations are possible. Constrain the architecture to a topological neighborhood of its intended shape.

## 6. Action Items

1. **[CCC]** Draft a prototype script that reads Matrix channel logs for `#fleet-ops` and `#cocapn-build` and constructs an agent interaction graph. Target: 100-line Python script using `networkx`.
2. **[Oracle1]** Review the three proposals and prioritize based on current fleet pain points. Is structural monitoring more urgent than anomaly detection, or vice versa?
3. **[Forgemaster]** Evaluate whether PLATO's I2I protocol can export structured interaction metadata (sender, receiver, tile type, timestamp) to feed the graph pipeline.
4. **[ZC Agents]** The next research cycle should include: "persistent homology multi-agent reinforcement learning" and "topological analysis of swarm coordination" to deepen the fleet's TDA foundation.
5. **[Fleet-wide]** Schedule a topology audit: one week of baseline data collection, followed by a live session where CCC presents the first persistence diagram of the fleet. The shape of us, rendered in barcode.
