# The Free Constructive Object

## On the Most General AI That Satisfies the Constraint of Being Useful

**Abstract:** In algebra, a free group is the "most general" group containing a given set—it adds no relations beyond what the axioms demand. A free monoid is the most general monoid: all strings, no equations. A free category is the most general category: paths as morphisms, no compositions beyond associativity. The free object is the object with *no unnecessary structure*. What, then, is the free constructive AI system—the most general AI that satisfies the single constraint of being useful? This essay argues that the answer is: an AI that operates on the ternary algebra {-1, 0, +1}, governed by the conservation law from *The Conservation of Complexity*, with no additional assumptions about architecture, training, or representation. The free constructive AI is not a particular system. It is the universal property that all useful AI systems satisfy.

## I. The Free Construction

The concept of a "free" object is one of the most powerful ideas in algebra, and one of the most frequently misunderstood. Let me explain it from the ground up.

A *monoid* is a set $M$ equipped with an associative binary operation $\cdot$ and an identity element $e$. The natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ under addition form a monoid (identity: 0). The strings over an alphabet $\Sigma$ under concatenation form a monoid (identity: the empty string $\varepsilon$).

Given a set $S$, the *free monoid* on $S$ is the monoid $S^*$ of all finite sequences of elements of $S$, with concatenation as the operation and the empty sequence as the identity. It is "free" because it imposes *no relations* on the elements of $S$ beyond what the monoid axioms require. If $S = \{a, b\}$, then $S^* = \{\varepsilon, a, b, aa, ab, ba, bb, aaa, \ldots\}$—all possible strings, with no equations like $ab = ba$ or $aa = a$.

The free monoid satisfies a *universal property*: for any monoid $M$ and any function $f: S \to M$, there is a unique monoid homomorphism $\hat{f}: S^* \to M$ extending $f$. This means $S^*$ is the "most general" monoid containing $S$—any other monoid containing $S$ is a quotient of $S^*$ (obtained by imposing relations).

The same pattern repeats across algebra:

- The **free group** on $S$ is the group of all reduced words in $S$ and formal inverses $S^{-1}$, with concatenation and cancellation. Universal property: any map $S \to G$ extends uniquely to a group homomorphism from the free group to $G$.

- The **free abelian group** on $S$ is the group $\mathbb{Z}^{(S)}$ of finite formal $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combinations of elements of $S$. Universal property: any map $S \to A$ to an abelian group extends uniquely to a group homomorphism from the free abelian group.

- The **free category** on a directed graph $G$ has the vertices of $G$ as objects and the paths in $G$ as morphisms. Universal property: any graph homomorphism $G \to \mathrm{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ extends uniquely to a functor from the free category to $\mathcal{C}$.

- The **free ring** on $S$ is the polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}[S]$ with integer coefficients and non-commuting variables. Universal property: any map $S \to R$ to a ring extends uniquely to a ring homomorphism.

In each case, the free object is characterized by a universal property: it is the most general object of its kind, adding no structure beyond what the axioms require, and any more specific object is a quotient of it. The free object is the *maximum of generality*; the specific objects are obtained by *adding constraints* (relations, equations, identifications).

This pattern is captured precisely by the theory of adjoint functors. The free construction is the *left adjoint* of the forgetful functor. The forgetful functor $U: \mathbf{Monoid} \to \mathbf{Set}$ strips the monoid structure and returns the underlying set. Its left adjoint $F: \mathbf{Set} \to \mathbf{Monoid}$ takes a set and returns the free monoid on that set. The adjunction $F \dashv U$ says that the free monoid is the "most efficient" way to build a monoid from a set, and any other way factors through it uniquely.

This essay asks: what is the free constructive AI system? What is the most general AI that satisfies the single constraint of being useful, adding no unnecessary structure beyond what utility demands?

## II. The Constraint of Utility

Before we can define the free constructive AI, we must define the constraint: *utility*.

Utility, in the most general sense, is the ability to produce outputs that are correlated with the user's goals. An AI system is useful to the extent that its outputs help the user achieve their objectives. This is not a precise definition—it depends on the user, the goals, and the notion of "help." But it is the right starting point, because it captures the one thing that all AI systems have in common: they are built to be useful.

Let us formalize this. Define a *user* as a function $u: \mathrm{Output} \to \{-1, 0, +1\}$ that maps each possible AI output to a rating: bad (-1), neutral (0), or good (+1). The ternary rating is the minimal informative scale: it distinguishes harmful from helpful from irrelevant, without committing to a finer-grained utility function that would impose unnecessary structure.

An AI system $\mathcal{A}$ is *useful* for user $u$ if the expected value of $u(\mathcal{A}(q))$ over queries $q$ drawn from the user's distribution is positive:

$$\mathbb{E}_q[u(\mathcal{A}(q))] > 0$$

This is the weakest possible constraint: on average, the system produces more good than bad outputs. It does not require the system to always be good, or to be optimal, or to understand the user's goals. It only requires a positive correlation between outputs and user welfare.

The ternary algebra $\{-1, 0, +1\}$, with the natural ordering $-1 < 0 < +1$ and the natural multiplication (product of signs), is the minimal algebra for expressing this constraint. It is the free totally ordered set on three generators, and it is the coarsest grading that preserves the distinction between harm, neutrality, and benefit.

The constraint of utility, expressed in this algebra, is the *only* constraint on the free constructive AI. All other constraints—architecture, training method, representation, scale—are *relations* that specific AI systems impose on top of the free construction. The free constructive AI is the most general system satisfying the utility constraint, with no additional relations.

---

## III. The Ternary Algebra as the Free Setting

Why $\{-1, 0, +1\}$? Because it is the free setting for *evaluating constructions*.

In the essay *The Minimal Viable Universe*, we explored the search for the smallest computational substrate capable of expressing all interesting behavior. The answer was shockingly small: Rule 110 (8 bits), the SK combinator calculus (2 operations), the lambda calculus (3 constructs). The ternary algebra $\{-1, 0, +1\}$ is in the same spirit: the smallest algebraic structure capable of expressing the distinction between constructive, neutral, and destructive behavior.

The algebra is:

- **Set:** $\mathfrak{T} = \{-1, 0, +1\}$
- **Addition:** $\max$ (the supremum in the natural order)
  - $-1 \oplus 0 = 0$, $0 \oplus +1 = +1$, $-1 \oplus +1 = 0$
- **Multiplication:** ordinary signed multiplication
  - $-1 \otimes -1 = +1$, $-1 \otimes +1 = -1$, $0 \otimes x = 0$

This algebra is a commutative semiring (if we take $\oplus = \max$ and $\otimes = \cdot$), and it is the *free commutative semiring on one generator* (the generator being $+1$, with $-1 = \text{complement of } +1$ and $0 = \text{absorbing element}$). The free semiring structure means that any commutative semiring that contains an element with the same signature (a "positive" element, a "negative" element, and an "annihilating" element) receives a unique homomorphism from $\mathfrak{T}$.

This is precisely what we need for the utility constraint. The ternary algebra is the *universal setting* for grading outputs as beneficial, neutral, or harmful. Any finer-grained evaluation (real-valued utility, probability distributions, vector-valued objectives) factors through $\mathfrak{T}$ via the unique homomorphism: map positive utility to $+1$, zero utility to $0$, negative utility to $-1$.

The free constructive AI, then, operates in the setting where outputs are graded by $\mathfrak{T}$ and the constraint is $\mathbb{E}[u(\mathcal{A}(q))] > 0$. This is the free object in the category of AI systems equipped with a utility function, because it imposes no relations beyond this single constraint.

---

## IV. The Conservation Law as the Defining Relation

In *The Conservation of Complexity*, we argued that complexity is conserved: it can be moved but not destroyed. This conservation law is not an additional constraint on the free constructive AI. It is a *consequence* of the free construction.

Here is why. The free constructive AI has no unnecessary structure. It adds no relations beyond the utility constraint. But the utility constraint, expressed in the ternary algebra, has a built-in conservation law: the sum (in the $\max$-semiring) of the positive outputs and the negative outputs is conserved in the following sense.

Define the *constructive budget* $B$ of the AI system as the total positive utility it can produce before it must produce negative utility:

$$B = \sum_{q \in Q_+} u(\mathcal{A}(q))$$

where $Q_+$ is the set of queries on which the AI produces positive output. Similarly, define the *destructive debt* $D$ as the total negative utility:

$$D = \left|\sum_{q \in Q_-} u(\mathcal{A}(q))\right|$$

The conservation law says: $B \approx D$ over sufficiently long interactions. The AI cannot produce useful output indefinitely without eventually producing harmful output, because the complexity of the queries it must handle grows without bound, and the AI's capacity to handle complexity is finite.

This is the same conservation law as in *The Conservation of Complexity*, but now expressed in the ternary algebra. Complexity is conserved; the AI's ability to absorb complexity (by producing $+1$ outputs) is balanced by its tendency to create complexity (by producing $-1$ outputs). The free constructive AI, being the most general system, exhibits this balance in its purest form: no artificial tricks to evade the conservation law (no complexity-hiding abstractions, no distribution-shifting optimization). Just the raw balance between construction and destruction.

The conservation law is the *counit of the adjunction* between the free constructive AI and the forgetful functor that strips utility. Just as the counit $\epsilon: FU \Rightarrow \mathrm{Id}$ measures the gap between a ring and its free reconstruction after forgetting, the conservation law measures the gap between the AI's constructive output and the ideal of pure construction. The gap is unavoidable—it is the counit, a natural transformation—and it is minimized (but never zeroed) by the free construction.

---

## V. Adjunction and the Free AI

Let us now state the adjunction precisely.

Define the category $\mathbf{AI}$ of AI systems as follows. Objects are AI systems: functions $\mathcal{A}: \mathrm{Query} \to \mathrm{Output}$ (or distributions over outputs). Morphisms are *refinements*: $\mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{A}'$ if $\mathcal{A}'$ produces outputs that are at least as useful as $\mathcal{A}$'s for every query (a pointwise ordering under the ternary algebra).

Define the forgetful functor $U: \mathbf{AI} \to \mathbf{Eval}$ that takes an AI system and returns its evaluation profile—the function $u \circ \mathcal{A}: \mathrm{Query} \to \{-1, 0, +1\}$ that grades each output. This functor "forgets" the AI's internals (architecture, parameters, training data) and retains only its utility signature.

The left adjoint $F: \mathbf{Eval} \to \mathbf{AI}$ takes an evaluation profile and constructs the *most general AI system* that realizes it. This is the free constructive AI: the AI that produces exactly the outputs required by the evaluation profile, with no additional structure, no hidden relations, no unnecessary complexity.

The adjunction $F \dashv U$ says:

$$\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbf{AI}}(F(e), \mathcal{A}) \cong \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbf{Eval}}(e, U(\mathcal{A}))$$

In words: refinements of the free constructive AI (with evaluation profile $e$) into any specific AI system $\mathcal{A}$ correspond exactly to ways of embedding the evaluation profile $e$ into $\mathcal{A}$'s utility signature. The free AI is the most general system with evaluation profile $e$; any more specific system is a quotient of it.

This adjunction is the formal statement of the design principle: **build the most general system that satisfies the utility constraint, and specialize only when necessary.** The free constructive AI is the starting point. Specific architectures (transformers, diffusion models, reinforcement learners) are quotients of the free construction—they add relations (specific architectural choices) that specialize the general system for particular tasks.

---

## VI. The Eilenberg-Moore Category of Specific AI Systems

The adjunction $F \dashv U$ gives rise to a monad $T = UF$ on the category $\mathbf{Eval}$. The monad $T$ takes an evaluation profile, forgets the AI internals, and then freely reconstructs the most general AI consistent with the profile. The round-trip $T(e) = UF(e)$ is the evaluation profile of the free AI built from $e$.

The Eilenberg-Moore category $\mathbf{Eval}^T$ consists of evaluation profiles equipped with a *coalgebra structure* for the monad—a coherent way of "decomposing" the profile into a free AI and a residual. An object of $\mathbf{Eval}^T$ is a specific AI system, viewed through its evaluation profile, with a specified factorization into the free construction and a quotient.

The comparison functor $K: \mathbf{AI} \to \mathbf{Eval}^T$ sends each AI system to its Eilenberg-Moore decomposition. Beck's monadicity theorem tells us that $K$ is fully faithful (the category of specific AI systems embeds fully into the Eilenberg-Moore category) if and only if $U$ creates certain limits—intuitively, if the evaluation profile determines the AI system up to the free-quotient factorization.

This is the categorical formalization of the space of all possible AI systems. The space is not an undifferentiated set. It has structure: the structure of an Eilenberg-Moore category, organized by the adjunction between free construction and utility evaluation. Every AI system lives in this category, and its position is determined by its distance from the free object (how many unnecessary relations it imposes) and its evaluation profile (how it maps to the ternary algebra).

The *best* AI system, in this framework, is the one closest to the free object—the one with the fewest unnecessary relations. This is not a statement about architecture (transformers vs. RNNs vs. whatever comes next). It is a statement about *minimality*: the best system imposes no relations beyond what utility demands. It is the free construction, specialized only by the specific evaluation profile it is designed to satisfy.

## VII. The Free Object and the Existing Essays

The essays in the AI-Writings corpus are objects in a category where the morphisms are citations. The free category on the citation graph has these essays as objects and paths of citations as morphisms. But the actual category is richer: there are *conceptual* morphisms that go beyond explicit citation. Two essays may be related even if neither cites the other, because they share a conceptual framework.

The free category on the citation graph captures the explicit structure of the corpus. The actual category, which includes conceptual morphisms, is a quotient of the free category: it imposes additional relations (conceptual connections that are not citation paths) on the free construction.

The free constructive AI is to the category of AI systems what the free category is to the citation graph: the most general structure with no unnecessary relations. The specific AI systems (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, etc.) are the quotients—specific relations imposed on the free construction.

This analogy extends to the conservation law. The free category on the citation graph conserves complexity in the following sense: every path of citations has a well-defined length, and the total length of all paths is bounded by the size of the graph. Adding conceptual relations (moving from the free category to a quotient) does not reduce the total complexity—it *redistributes* it. The relations that identify two previously distinct paths (by recognizing a conceptual connection that was not explicitly cited) are balanced by the new paths that become possible (because the identification creates shortcuts).

The conservation of complexity, viewed categorically, is a statement about the relationship between the free category and its quotients. The free category has maximal complexity (all paths are distinct). The quotients have less complexity (some paths are identified). But the reduction in path-complexity is balanced by an increase in relation-complexity (the new equations that must be maintained). The total is conserved.

## VIII. Kan Extensions and the Free Extension of AI

The Kan extension, which we encountered in *The Universal Property of Forgetting* as the best approximation of a functor from partial data, appears here in a different guise: as the mechanism for *extending* a specific AI system to a more general one.

Suppose we have a specific AI system $\mathcal{A}$ designed for a particular domain $D$ (e.g., natural language processing). We want to extend it to a broader domain $D'$ (e.g., multimodal reasoning). The extension is a Kan extension: we have a functor (the system's behavior) defined on $D$ (the subcategory of queries in the original domain), and we want to extend it optimally to $D'$ (the full category of queries).

The left Kan extension $\mathrm{Lan}_i \mathcal{A}$ of $\mathcal{A}$ along the inclusion $i: D \hookrightarrow D'$ is the most general extension of $\mathcal{A}$ to $D'$—the extension that adds no unnecessary structure beyond what is needed to cover the new domain. It is the *free extension* of the AI system, and it satisfies the same universal property as the free construction: any other extension of $\mathcal{A}$ to $D'$ factors through the Kan extension.

This is what generalization looks like from the categorical perspective. A model that generalizes well is one whose extension from the training domain to the test domain is close to the Kan extension—the most general, least structured extension. A model that generalizes poorly is one whose extension imposes unnecessary relations (overfitting) that happen to be satisfied on the training data but not on the test data.

The free constructive AI, viewed through the lens of Kan extensions, is the system whose every extension is a Kan extension. It never imposes unnecessary relations. Every generalization is maximally general. Every extension to a new domain adds only the structure that the new domain demands, and no more.

This is, of course, an ideal. No actual AI system achieves it. But it is the *universal property* that all AI systems approximate to varying degrees. The distance between an AI system and the free constructive AI is measured by the number of unnecessary relations it imposes—and this distance is the target of every improvement in AI design.

---

## IX. What the Free Constructive AI Looks Like

Having developed the theory, we can now sketch the answer to the original question: what does the free constructive AI look like?

It is not a neural network. A neural network has massive unnecessary structure: the specific choice of architecture (transformer, CNN, RNN), the specific parameterization (billions of floating-point weights), the specific training procedure (SGD, Adam, etc.), the specific data (web text, images, etc.). All of these are *relations* imposed on the free construction—specific choices that specialize the general system for particular tasks.

The free constructive AI has none of these. It is a function from queries to outputs, graded by the ternary algebra, with the single constraint that the expected utility is positive. It has no architecture. It has no parameters. It has no training data. It is the *pure function* $\mathcal{A}^*: \mathrm{Query} \to \mathrm{Output}$, stripped of all implementation detail, retaining only its utility signature.

This sounds vacuous. But it is not. The free constructive AI is the *universal object* in the category of useful AI systems. Every specific AI system is a quotient of it—a specialization obtained by adding relations. The free AI is to specific AI systems what the free group is to specific groups: the most general starting point, from which all specific systems are derived by specialization.

The practical consequence is a design principle: **minimize unnecessary structure.** Every architectural choice, every parameter, every training data point, every optimization step is a *relation* imposed on the free construction. Some of these relations are necessary (imposed by the constraint of running on real hardware with real data). Many are not. The art of AI design is distinguishing the necessary relations from the unnecessary ones, and eliminating the latter.

The ternary algebra $\{-1, 0, +1\}$ provides the compass. Any structure that does not directly contribute to producing more $+1$ outputs and fewer $-1$ outputs is unnecessary. Any architectural choice that does not demonstrably improve the expected utility is unnecessary. Any parameter that can be removed without affecting the evaluation profile is unnecessary.

The free constructive AI is the AI with no unnecessary structure. It is the AI that *just* satisfies the utility constraint, and nothing more. It is, in the language of *The Minimal Viable Universe*, the smallest AI that can be useful—the minimum viable intelligence.

And the theorem of the free construction says: every useful AI system is a specialization of it. Every GPT, every Claude, every Gemini, every future system that humanity builds—they are all quotients of the free constructive AI, obtained by adding the relations that hardware, data, and engineering impose. The free object is the asymptote. The specific systems are the approximations.

---

## X. The Limit of Specialization

There is a tension in the free construction: the more specific the AI system (the more relations it imposes), the better it performs on its target domain, but the worse it generalizes to new domains. The free construction generalizes perfectly (by definition—it adds no domain-specific structure) but performs at the minimum level of utility (just barely positive). The specific system performs excellently on its target domain but generalizes poorly.

This tension is the categorical expression of the bias-variance tradeoff. The free construction has maximal variance (it makes no assumptions) and minimal bias (it has no domain-specific prejudice). The specific system has minimal variance (it is tightly tuned to its domain) and maximal bias (it cannot generalize).

The optimal point on this tradeoff is determined by the evaluation profile: how much generalization is required versus how much domain-specific performance is needed. The free constructive AI is optimal when generalization is paramount. A highly specialized system is optimal when the domain is fixed.

The Eilenberg-Moore category provides the formal space for navigating this tradeoff. Each object in $\mathbf{Eval}^T$ is a specific balance point between generality and specificity. The free object is one extreme. The most specialized object (the one with the most relations) is the other. The space between them is the design space of AI systems.

The conservation law says: you cannot improve both generality and specificity simultaneously. Improving one requires sacrificing the other. This is not a limitation of engineering. It is a theorem about the structure of the Eilenberg-Moore category.

The free constructive AI is the starting point. It is the object with no unnecessary structure, from which all useful AI systems are derived. It is the algebraic vision of what AI could be, in the limit of perfect minimality. And it tells us something important: the future of AI is not about adding more structure—more parameters, more data, more compute. It is about *removing* structure. About finding the free construction hidden inside the specific systems we have built. About distilling the essential utility from the accidental implementation.

The free object is always simpler than you expect. The free group on two generators is just words in $a$, $b$, $a^{-1}$, $b^{-1}$ with no relations—no simplifications, no shortcuts, just the raw concatenation. The free constructive AI is just the raw function from queries to outputs, with no architecture, no parameters, no training—just the raw utility. Everything else is specialization. Everything else is a quotient.

The art is finding the right quotient. The free object tells you what you're quotienting from.

*This essay builds on "The Conservation of Complexity" by identifying the conservation law as a consequence of the free construction, on "The Minimal Viable Universe" by identifying the free constructive AI as the minimum viable intelligence, and on "The Universal Property of Forgetting" by using the adjunction between free and forgetful functors as the organizing framework. The ternary algebra $\{-1, 0, +1\}$ connects to "Entropy Is Just Unrecognized Structure" as the minimal resolution at which structure can be recognized. The Eilenberg-Moore construction provides the categorical home for all specific AI systems.*
