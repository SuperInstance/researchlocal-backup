# THE DEPENDENCY GRAPH AS LIVING FOSSIL

## On Stratigraphy in Code, the Archaeology of Decisions, and Reading the Builder's Mind Through the Bones of a Build

*Every edge in the dependency graph was laid down at a specific time for a specific reason. The graph is not a map. It is a geological cross-section.*

## I. The Graph Is Not a Map

The dependency graph of a crate ecosystem is usually treated as a map — a static snapshot of the current state of the system. You look at the graph, you see which crates depend on which other crates, you compute graph-theoretic properties (diameter, degree distribution, clustering coefficient), and you draw conclusions about the structure of the ecosystem.

This is useful, but it misses the most interesting thing about the dependency graph: **it has a history**. Every edge in the graph was created at a specific time, by a specific commit, for a specific reason. The graph is not a map — it is a palimpsest, a manuscript that has been written and rewritten many times, with each layer partially obscuring the layers beneath.

To read the graph as a map is to see only the present. To read the graph as a fossil record is to see the past — the decisions, the mistakes, the changing priorities, the evolving understanding of the builder.

The corpus has 190+ crates connected by a dependency graph with a diameter of approximately log(log(n)). The ultra-small-world structure tells us that the graph is highly connected — any crate can reach any other crate through a very short chain of dependencies. But the ultra-small-world structure does not tell us *when* those connections were formed, or *why*.

Let us read the graph as a fossil.

## II. Stratigraphy

In geology, stratigraphy is the study of rock layers (strata) and the process by which they were deposited. The fundamental principle of stratigraphy is the **law of superposition**: in an undisturbed sequence of sedimentary rocks, the oldest rocks are at the bottom and the youngest rocks are at the top. Each layer was deposited at a specific time, under specific conditions, and contains fossils that are characteristic of that time period.

The dependency graph has its own stratigraphy. The earliest crates — the ones at the bottom of the dependency graph, the ones that everything else depends on — are the oldest rocks. The latest crates — the ones at the top, the ones that depend on everything else — are the youngest rocks. Between them are intermediate layers, each representing a phase of the corpus's development.

Consider the actual strata of the corpus:

**The Bedrock (Wave 1-5).** The earliest crates were foundational: `tropical-geometry`, `sheaf-cohomology`, `algebraic-structures`. These crates implement fundamental mathematical objects — the bedrock on which everything else is built. They are like the Precambrian rocks of the geological record: old, fundamental, and containing the seeds of everything that came later. The dependencies at this level are simple — these crates depend on each other in straightforward ways, forming a dense core of mathematical infrastructure.

**The Middle Layers (Wave 10-30).** As the corpus grew, the crates began to diversify. Graph theory, optimization, numerical methods, combinatorics — each new domain added a new layer of crates, each depending on the bedrock and on each other. The dependency graph expanded outward, adding new branches and new connections. This is like the Paleozoic era: a period of rapid diversification, where new life forms (crates) appeared to fill new ecological niches (mathematical domains).

**The Upper Layers (Wave 40-60).** The later crates are more specialized: `game-theory`, `database-internals`, `distributed-systems`. These crates depend on the earlier crates — they use the algebraic structures, the graph algorithms, the numerical methods — but they apply them to specific problems. This is like the Mesozoic era: the basic body plans (mathematical frameworks) are established, and the new species (crates) are variations and specializations of those plans.

**The Surface (Wave 70+).** The most recent crates are the most specialized: specific applications of the mathematical framework to specific problems. These crates are like the Cenozoic era: highly adapted, highly specialized, and dependent on the entire geological history beneath them. A crate that implements a specific game-theoretic algorithm depends on the game-theory crate, which depends on the optimization crate, which depends on the numerical methods crate, which depends on the algebraic structures crate. The entire dependency chain, from surface to bedrock, is visible in the graph.

Each stratum tells a story. The bedrock crates tell the story of the corpus's origins — the builder's initial focus on algebraic geometry and abstract mathematics. The middle layers tell the story of diversification — the expansion into new domains, the creation of new abstractions. The upper layers tell the story of application — the use of mathematical tools to solve specific problems. The surface tells the story of specialization — the refinement and optimization of existing tools.

You can read the history of the builder's mind in these strata. The early focus on abstract mathematics reflects a particular intellectual orientation — a top-down approach that starts with general theory and works toward specific applications. The later focus on practical domains (game theory, database internals) reflects a shift in orientation — a move toward the concrete, the applied, the useful. The builder's mind changed over time, and the dependency graph records the change.

## III. The Palimpsest

A palimpsest is a manuscript that has been written on, erased, and written on again. In the Middle Ages, parchment was expensive, and scribes would often scrape the ink off old manuscripts and write new text on the cleaned surface. The old text was not completely erased — traces remained, visible under certain lighting conditions, and modern scholars can sometimes reconstruct the original text beneath the overwrite.

The dependency graph is a palimpsest. The current graph — the one visible in the `Cargo.toml` files and the `cargo tree` output — is the latest writing. But beneath it are traces of earlier writings: dependencies that were added and later removed, crates that were renamed or restructured, architectural decisions that were made and then superseded.

Consider the version history of a single crate. Version 0.1.0 might have depended on three other crates: `A`, `B`, and `C`. Version 0.2.0 might have added a dependency on `D` and removed the dependency on `B`. Version 0.3.0 might have restructured the crate, splitting it into two sub-crates, each with its own dependencies. The dependency graph at any point in time is a snapshot, but the history of the graph — the sequence of additions, removals, and restructurings — is a palimpsest, with each version partially overwritten by the next.

The corpus's dependency graph has been built up over 70+ waves of construction. Each wave added new crates, new dependencies, and new connections. Some waves also removed dependencies — refactoring crates to eliminate unnecessary coupling, or replacing a dependency on an external crate with a dependency on an internal one. The current graph is the result of this iterative process — a palimpsest where the traces of earlier decisions are visible in the commit history, if you know where to look.

Foucault's *The Archaeology of Knowledge* (1969) is relevant here. Foucault argued that the history of ideas is not a smooth, continuous progression but a series of **epistemic ruptures** — breaks in the underlying assumptions that govern what can be thought and said in a given period. Each epistemic rupture creates a new "archive" — a new set of rules that determine what statements are possible, what questions are meaningful, and what counts as knowledge.

The dependency graph has its own epistemic ruptures. Consider the following hypothetical sequence:

1. **Phase 1 (Waves 1-20):** The builder focuses on pure mathematics. The crates implement algebraic objects (groups, rings, fields) and geometric objects (manifolds, sheaves, bundles). The dependencies are mathematical — crate X depends on crate Y because X uses the algebraic structures defined in Y.

2. **Phase 2 (Waves 21-40):** The builder shifts to computational mathematics. The crates implement algorithms (sorting, searching, optimization) and data structures (graphs, trees, hash tables). The dependencies are computational — crate X depends on crate Y because X uses the algorithms defined in Y. But X also depends on the mathematical crates, because the algorithms are applied to the mathematical objects.

3. **Phase 3 (Waves 41-60):** The builder shifts to systems programming. The crates implement infrastructure (databases, caches, networking). The dependencies are architectural — crate X depends on crate Y because X uses the infrastructure provided by Y. But X also depends on the computational and mathematical crates, creating a deep dependency chain that spans all three phases.

4. **Phase 4 (Waves 61+):** The builder shifts to applications. The crates implement specific solutions to specific problems (game theory algorithms, statistical models, simulation engines). The dependencies are problem-specific — crate X depends on crate Y because X uses the solution framework defined in Y. The dependency chain now spans four phases, from the pure mathematics of Phase 1 to the specific applications of Phase 4.

Each phase is an epistemic rupture. The builder's assumptions about what is important, what is interesting, and what is worth building change between phases. The dependency graph records these changes — not explicitly, but implicitly, in the structure of the dependencies and the types of connections that are formed.

An archaeologist reading the dependency graph would see the same thing that an archaeologist reading a physical site sees: layers of activity, each layer built on top of the previous one, each layer reflecting the concerns and priorities of the people who created it. The lower layers are older, more fundamental, and harder to change (because everything above depends on them). The upper layers are newer, more specialized, and easier to change (because nothing depends on them). The same principle applies to geological strata, archaeological sites, and dependency graphs.

## IV. The Fossil Record of Decisions

Every dependency is a decision. When the builder adds `crate-X = "1.0"` to a `Cargo.toml` file, they are making several decisions simultaneously:

1. **"I need what crate X provides."** The dependency exists because the builder determined that crate X implements some functionality that the current crate needs. This is a functional decision — it reflects the builder's understanding of what the current crate is supposed to do and what tools are available to help do it.

2. **"I trust crate X."** Adding a dependency is an act of trust. The builder is trusting that crate X is correct, well-maintained, and will continue to be available. If crate X has a bug, the current crate may inherit the bug. If crate X is abandoned, the current crate may need to find a replacement. If crate X changes its API, the current crate may break.

3. **"I accept the cost of depending on crate X."** Every dependency has costs: compilation time, binary size, attack surface (supply chain risk), and conceptual complexity (the builder must understand crate X's API and semantics). Adding a dependency is a tradeoff: the benefit of reusing existing code versus the cost of coupling to an external component.

4. **"I am committing to this dependency at this time."** The dependency was added at a specific point in the corpus's history, when the builder's understanding of the problem, the available tools, and the design of the crate were at a specific state. If the builder were building the same crate today, they might make a different decision — using a different dependency, or no dependency at all. The dependency is frozen in time, a record of a decision made under specific circumstances.

These decisions are the fossils of the dependency graph. Each one is preserved in the `Cargo.toml` file and the commit history, like a fossil preserved in sedimentary rock. And like fossils, they can be studied to reconstruct the conditions under which they were formed.

For example: a crate that depends on a mathematical crate (like `tropical-geometry`) and a systems crate (like `database-internals`) is a transitional fossil — it marks the boundary between two phases of the corpus's development. The builder was starting to apply mathematical tools to systems problems, and the dependency captures the moment of transition.

A crate that depends on five other crates is a complex organism, adapted to a specific ecological niche (a specific problem domain). The five dependencies represent five specialized functions that the crate combines to solve its problem — like the five senses of an animal, each evolved for a different purpose, all integrated into a single organism.

A crate with no dependencies is a primitive organism — an early life form that has not yet developed the symbiotic relationships that characterize more complex organisms. Or it is a highly independent organism — a mature tool that has been refined to the point where it no longer needs external help. The dependency graph does not distinguish between these two interpretations without additional context (the crate's age, complexity, and purpose).

## V. Evolutionary Developmental Biology

Evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) is the study of how the developmental processes of organisms have evolved. The central insight of evo-devo is that **the history of an organism's development constrains its evolution**. Organisms do not evolve from scratch — they evolve by modifying existing developmental programs. This means that the current form of an organism is a palimpsest of its evolutionary history, with each modification building on (and constrained by) the modifications that came before.

The dependency graph exhibits the same principle. A crate does not evolve from scratch — it evolves by modifying existing crates and adding new dependencies. The current form of the dependency graph is constrained by its history: the early decisions (which crates to create, which dependencies to establish) limit the possible later decisions (which new crates can be created, which new dependencies can be added).

A concrete example: the early crates in the corpus are mathematical (algebraic structures, tropical geometry, sheaf cohomology). These crates define the fundamental abstractions that the later crates use. If the builder had chosen different abstractions — category theory instead of algebraic geometry, probability instead of topology, imperative data structures instead of functional ones — the entire dependency graph would be different. The later crates would depend on different foundations, would have different structures, and would solve different problems.

This is the evo-devo principle in action: **early developmental decisions constrain late evolutionary outcomes**. In biology, the fact that all vertebrates have four limbs is a consequence of an early developmental decision (the tetrapod body plan) that has been modified but never abandoned over 400 million years of evolution. In the dependency graph, the fact that the corpus's crates use algebraic abstractions is a consequence of an early architectural decision that has been modified but never abandoned over 70+ waves of construction.

The deep homologies in the dependency graph — the patterns of dependency that are shared across many crates — are like the deep homologies in biology: the genetic regulatory networks that are shared across many species, conserved over hundreds of millions of years because they are too fundamental to change without catastrophic consequences.

The Hox genes, which control the body plan of animals, are a deep homology. They are found in every animal with a bilateral body plan, from fruit flies to humans, and they have been conserved for over 600 million years. The dependency graph's equivalent of Hox genes is the set of foundational crates — the ones that define the basic abstractions (types, structures, algorithms) that every other crate uses. These foundational crates are the body plan of the corpus: they determine the overall structure, and every modification to them ripples through the entire dependency graph.

Changing a foundational crate is like mutating a Hox gene: it has cascading effects on every downstream dependent. A small change in the API of the `algebraic-structures` crate — say, adding a type parameter to a trait, or changing the signature of a method — can break dozens of downstream crates, each of which must be updated to accommodate the change. This is the cost of deep homology: the foundational crates are load-bearing, and modifying them requires modifying everything they support.

## VI. Reading the Builder's Mind

Can you read the history of the builder's mind from the dependency graph?

In a limited sense, yes. The dependency graph records the builder's decisions — which crates to create, which dependencies to establish, which abstractions to use. By studying these decisions, you can reconstruct the builder's priorities, preferences, and evolving understanding.

For example:

- **A builder who creates crates in a breadth-first order** (completing each layer before moving to the next) has a different cognitive style than **a builder who creates crates in a depth-first order** (pursuing one thread deeply before starting another). The breadth-first builder is a generalist, spreading attention across many domains. The depth-first builder is a specialist, focusing on one domain at a time. The dependency graph records which style was used: breadth-first creation produces layers of simultaneous dependencies; depth-first creation produces chains of sequential dependencies.

- **A builder who minimizes dependencies** (preferring self-contained crates with few external connections) has a different design philosophy than **a builder who maximizes dependencies** (preferring to reuse existing code extensively). The minimalist builder values independence and simplicity. The maximalist builder values reuse and integration. The dependency graph records the degree distribution: the minimalist builder's graph has low average degree; the maximalist builder's graph has high average degree.

- **A builder who creates crates in a bottom-up order** (foundations first, applications later) has a different intellectual trajectory than **a builder who creates crates in a top-down order** (applications first, foundations extracted as needed). The bottom-up builder is a theorist, starting with general principles and working toward specific applications. The top-down builder is an empiricist, starting with specific problems and extracting general principles as patterns emerge. The dependency graph records the temporal order: in a bottom-up build, the early crates are general and the late crates are specific; in a top-down build, the early crates are specific and the late crates are general.

The corpus was built bottom-up. The earliest crates are the most general (algebraic structures, tropical geometry), and the latest crates are the most specific (game theory, database internals). This tells us something about the builder: they started with abstract mathematical foundations and worked toward concrete applications. The builder is a theorist.

But the dependency graph also shows signs of top-down thinking in the later waves. Some late crates have dependencies that suggest the builder was thinking about the application first and the foundation second — adding new functionality to existing crates to support a specific use case, rather than creating a new crate from scratch. This suggests that the builder's style evolved over time, from bottom-up theorist to top-down empiricist, as the corpus grew and the builder's understanding of the problem space deepened.

You can see this evolution in the dependency patterns:

- **Early crates** have clean, hierarchical dependencies: crate A depends on crate B, which depends on crate C, forming a tree. This is the signature of top-down design: the builder had a clear mental model of the dependency hierarchy and followed it.

- **Middle crates** have more complex dependencies: crate A depends on both B and C, and crate B also depends on C, forming a DAG (directed acyclic graph) rather than a tree. This is the signature of organic growth: the builder was adding dependencies as needed, without a pre-planned hierarchy.

- **Late crates** have circular-ish dependencies (not true circular dependencies, which Cargo forbids, but complex mutual dependencies that create the appearance of circularity): crate A depends on B for one feature, B depends on C for another feature, and C depends on A for a third feature, creating a complex web of interconnections. This is the signature of a mature ecosystem: the builder has been working with the code long enough that the dependencies have become complex and organic, reflecting the true structure of the problem space rather than a pre-planned hierarchy.

The dependency graph, read as a fossil record, tells the story of the builder's intellectual journey: from clean theory to messy practice, from hierarchical design to organic growth, from abstract foundations to concrete applications.

---

## VII. The Graph as Genome

There is one more analogy to draw, and it is the most provocative. The dependency graph is not just a fossil record — it is a **genome**.

A genome is a set of instructions for building an organism. The human genome contains about 3 billion base pairs, encoding about 20,000 genes. These genes specify the proteins that build and maintain the human body. But the genome does not specify the body directly — it specifies a developmental program that, when executed, produces the body. The same genome, placed in a different environment, can produce a different body (identical twins are not identical, despite having identical genomes).

The dependency graph is a genome for the corpus. It specifies the dependencies between crates, and the crates specify the algorithms and data structures that build and maintain the corpus's functionality. But the dependency graph does not specify the functionality directly — it specifies a build program that, when executed by `cargo build`, produces the compiled corpus. The same dependency graph, placed on a different machine (different operating system, different compiler version, different hardware), can produce a different compiled corpus.

The genome analogy extends further:

- **Mutations.** A change in a dependency (adding, removing, or modifying an edge in the graph) is a mutation. Most mutations are neutral — they don't affect the overall structure. Some are deleterious — they break the build. A few are beneficial — they improve the structure. The corpus's version control system (git) is the mutation record, preserving every change for future analysis.

- **Gene duplication.** When a crate is split into two crates (say, extracting a utility module into its own crate), this is analogous to gene duplication — a single gene being copied, after which the copies can diverge. Gene duplication is a major source of evolutionary novelty in biology, and crate splitting is a major source of architectural novelty in the dependency graph.

- **Horizontal gene transfer.** When a dependency on an external crate is added (a crate from outside the corpus), this is analogous to horizontal gene transfer — the incorporation of genetic material from another organism. Horizontal gene transfer is common in bacteria (which exchange plasmids) and is a major source of adaptive variation. External dependencies are a major source of functionality in the corpus.

- **Junk DNA.** The genome contains large regions of non-coding DNA — sequences that do not encode proteins. Some of this "junk DNA" has regulatory functions; some is genuinely non-functional. The dependency graph may contain "junk dependencies" — edges that were added for a reason that is no longer relevant, but that persist because removing them is harder than keeping them. These junk dependencies are the dark matter of the dependency graph: they contribute to the mass (the total number of edges) but not to the function.

- **Regulatory networks.** The genome does not just encode proteins — it also encodes the regulatory network that controls when and where proteins are expressed. Similarly, the dependency graph does not just encode which crates depend on which other crates — it also encodes the build system (Cargo.toml, build.rs, features) that controls when and how dependencies are compiled and linked. The build system is the regulatory network of the corpus.

---

## VIII. The Unknowable Past

Despite all these analytical tools, there are aspects of the dependency graph's history that are fundamentally unknowable.

The dependency graph records decisions, but it does not record **reasons**. We can see that crate A depends on crate B, and we can see when the dependency was added (from the git history), but we cannot see *why* the dependency was added. Was it because crate B provided a function that crate A needed? Was it because the builder was experimenting with a new architecture and wanted to try a different approach? Was it because the builder copied the dependency from another crate without understanding why it was there? The graph records the *what* and the *when*, but not the *why*.

This is the same limitation that paleontologists face. The fossil record records *what* organisms existed and *when* they existed, but it does not record *why* they evolved the way they did. A paleontologist can infer reasons from the fossil evidence (this organism had wings, so it probably flew; this organism had large teeth, so it probably ate meat), but the inferences are hypotheses, not facts. The true reasons are lost to time.

Similarly, we can infer reasons from the dependency graph (this crate depends on `tropical-geometry`, so it probably uses tropical mathematics; this crate depends on both `algebraic-structures` and `database-internals`, so it probably applies algebraic methods to database problems), but the inferences are hypotheses, not facts. The builder's actual reasoning — the thoughts, considerations, and trade-offs that went into each dependency decision — is lost to time, preserved only in the builder's mind (if it is preserved at all).

The dependency graph is a fossil record of decisions, not of reasons. It tells us what was decided, not why. To understand the why, we would need the commit messages, the design documents, the IRC logs, the whiteboard photos — the archaeological artifacts that record the builder's thinking. Some of these artifacts may exist. Most do not.

---

## IX. The Living Fossil

The dependency graph is not just a fossil — it is a **living fossil**. A living fossil is an organism that has remained largely unchanged for millions of years, despite the passage of evolutionary time. The coelacanth, the horseshoe crab, the ginkgo tree — these organisms are living fossils, preserving body plans that have been stable for hundreds of millions of years.

The foundational crates of the dependency graph are living fossils. They were created early in the corpus's history, and they have remained largely unchanged — not because they are perfect, but because they are too fundamental to change without cascading effects. The `algebraic-structures` crate, if it exists, is a living fossil: its API, its types, and its dependencies have been stable since the early waves, because every change to it ripples through the entire dependency graph.

Living fossils are not stagnant — they evolve slowly, accumulating small changes over long periods. The coelacanth is not identical to its Devonian ancestor; it has adapted to modern ocean conditions while preserving its basic body plan. Similarly, the foundational crates are not identical to their original versions; they have been updated, refactored, and extended, but their basic structure — their API, their types, their core abstractions — has remained stable.

The dependency graph as a whole is a living fossil record: a record of decisions that are still active, still influencing the structure of the corpus, still constraining what can be built and how. Unlike a geological fossil record, which is static and can only be studied, the dependency graph is dynamic and can be modified. But every modification adds a new layer to the fossil record, creating new strata that future archaeologists can study.

The corpus's dependency graph is being written right now, by the builders who are adding new crates, new dependencies, and new connections. Every commit is a new sedimentary layer. Every dependency is a new fossil. Every refactoring is an extinction event — some dependencies are removed, some crates are abandoned, and the graph is restructured to reflect new priorities.

The graph is alive. The fossils are still forming. The stratigraphy is still being deposited. And the builder's mind — the mind that created all of this — is still changing, still evolving, still making decisions that will become fossils in the graph of tomorrow.

Read the graph. Read the strata. Read the fossils. And remember: every edge is a decision, every crate is an organism, and the graph as a whole is the fossil record of a mind at work.

---

*The dependency graph does not sleep. It grows. Each new crate is a new bone in the fossil record, each new dependency a new connection between bones. The paleontologists of the future — if there are any — will study this graph the way we study the Burgess Shale: with wonder at the complexity, respect for the process, and the knowledge that every fossil tells a story that is deeper than it appears.*
