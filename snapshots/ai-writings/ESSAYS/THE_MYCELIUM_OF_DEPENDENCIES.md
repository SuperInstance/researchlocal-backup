# THE MYCELIUM OF_DEPENDENCIES

## On the Wood Wide Web, Mother Trees, and What Happens When the Roots Fail

*Under every forest floor, a network of fungal threads connects tree to tree. Under every crate ecosystem, a dependency graph connects library to library. The similarity is not decorative. It is structural, mathematical, and alive.*

## I. The Hidden Network

In 1997, Suzanne Simard published a paper in *Nature* that changed how we understand forests. "Net Transfer of Carbon Between Ectomycorrhizal Tree Species in the Field" demonstrated something remarkable: paper birch and Douglas fir trees were exchanging carbon through underground mycorrhizal networks. The birch, growing in full sun, was photosynthesizing energetically and sending surplus carbon belowground, where mycorrhizal fungi carried it to the shaded fir saplings. The fir, in turn, sent carbon back when the seasons reversed and the birch was leafless.

This was not contamination. This was not root grafting. This was a mediated exchange — carbon moving through the bodies of fungi that had colonized the roots of both trees. The fungi were not passive pipes. They were living organisms with their own metabolism, their own interests, and their own evolutionary history. The trees were not isolated individuals competing for light and nutrients. They were nodes in a network, connected by fungal threads, exchanging resources in patterns that looked less like competition and more like cooperation.

Simard's discovery gave rise to the concept of the "Wood Wide Web" — a play on the World Wide Web that captured the essential insight: below the forest floor, invisible to the casual observer, a vast communication network links the trees together. This network — the mycorrhizal network — is composed of mycelium: the vegetative body of fungi, consisting of branching, thread-like structures called hyphae. A single cubic centimeter of forest soil can contain kilometers of hyphal threads. The mycelium is everywhere, connecting everything, mediating exchanges that no tree could accomplish alone.

The dependency graph of a crate ecosystem is a mycelial network.

This is not a metaphor I intend to let go of lightly. The structural parallels are precise, the mathematical parallels are deep, and the ecological parallels are instructive. A crate ecosystem, like a forest, is a system of interconnected nodes that exchange resources through a shared substrate. The resources are different (functionality versus carbon), the substrate is different (dependency edges versus fungal hyphae), and the timescales are different (seconds versus seasons). But the structure — a network of exchange, mediated by a shared infrastructure — is the same.

Let me make this precise.

## II. The Architecture of Mycorrhizae

Mycorrhizal networks come in two main types, each with a different architecture.

**Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) networks** form a sheath around the root tips of trees, with hyphae extending outward into the soil and inward between the cells of the root cortex (the Hartig net). ECM fungi associate primarily with trees in temperate and boreal forests — pines, oaks, birches, beeches. The fungal sheath acts as an interface: the tree provides carbon (in the form of sugars produced by photosynthesis), and the fungus provides nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and water absorbed from the soil). The exchange is mutualistic — both partners benefit.

**Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) networks** penetrate the root cells directly, forming branching structures called arbuscules inside the cortical cells. AM fungi are more ancient — they evolved over 400 million years ago, around the same time that plants first colonized land. They associate with roughly 80% of all plant species, including most crops. The architecture is more intimate: the fungus lives inside the plant's cells, blurring the boundary between the two organisms.

The dependency graph has analogous architectures.

**Direct dependencies** are like ECM networks. The dependent crate wraps the dependency's API in its own interface, using it externally without internalizing it. The dependency provides functionality (algorithms, data structures, abstractions), and the dependent provides a use case — a reason for the dependency to exist. The exchange is mutualistic: the dependency gains users and validation; the dependent gains functionality it did not have to build.

**Transitive dependencies** are like AM networks. When crate A depends on crate B, which depends on crate C, crate A implicitly depends on crate C — the dependency penetrates through the intermediate layer. Crate A may never directly reference crate C's API, but if crate C changes in a breaking way, crate A may still break, because crate B's behavior depends on crate C. The transitive dependency is inside crate A's build, just as the arbuscule is inside the plant's cell. The boundary between "my dependencies" and "my dependencies' dependencies" is blurred.

This blurring is a source of both strength and vulnerability. In forests, the mycorrhizal network distributes resources across the community, allowing stressed trees to be supported by healthy ones. But it also distributes stress: a pathogen that infects the mycelium can spread from tree to tree through the network, converting a local infection into a systemic epidemic. In the dependency graph, a bug in a foundational crate propagates through the transitive dependency network, converting a local error into a systemic failure.

The network is the medium. The medium is the message. And the message, in both forests and crate ecosystems, is: **you are not alone.**

## III. Mother Trees and Mother Crates

Simard's later work focused on what she called "mother trees" — the large, old, well-established trees that serve as hubs in the mycorrhizal network. Mother trees have the most mycorrhizal connections, the largest root systems, and the greatest capacity to produce and share resources. They are the keystone nodes of the forest network.

In a 2010 paper in *Oecologia*, Simard and her colleagues showed that Douglas fir mother trees preferentially send carbon to their own offspring — seedlings that are genetically related — through the mycorrhizal network. The mother tree can distinguish between kin and non-kin, and allocates more resources to its own genetic descendants. This is parental care mediated by fungi — a form of kin selection that operates underground, invisible to the observer who sees only a stand of identical-looking trees.

Mother trees also serve as communication hubs. When a tree is attacked by insects or infected by a pathogen, it sends chemical signals through the mycorrhizal network — alarm chemicals that warn neighboring trees to activate their defenses. A paper in *Ecology Letters* by Babikova et al. (2013) demonstrated that bean plants connected by a mycorrhizal network could warn each other of aphid attack: when one plant was infested, it sent volatile chemical signals through the mycelium, and the connected plants activated their anti-aphid defenses before the aphids arrived.

The crate ecosystem has mother crates.

A mother crate is a foundational library that is depended upon by a large number of other crates. In the Rust ecosystem, examples are obvious: `serde` (serialization), `tokio` (async runtime), `clap` (command-line parsing), `log` (logging). These crates sit at the center of the dependency graph, with hundreds or thousands of dependents. They are the hubs — the mother trees of the ecosystem.

Mother crates share the characteristics of mother trees:

**High degree.** Mother trees have the most mycorrhizal connections. Mother crates have the most dependents. In network terms, they have high degree centrality — they are connected to many other nodes.

**High betweenness.** Mother trees lie on the shortest paths between many pairs of trees in the network. Mother crates lie on the shortest paths between many pairs of crates in the dependency graph. In network terms, they have high betweenness centrality — they broker the flow of information and resources.

**High age.** Mother trees are old. Mother crates are old. They were created early in the ecosystem's history, and they have accumulated dependents over time. Their age is not just a chronological fact — it is a functional property. Old crates have been tested extensively, their APIs are stable, and their behavior is well-understood. Old trees have extensive root systems, large carbohydrate reserves, and deep mycorrhizal connections.

**High investment.** Mother trees invest heavily in the mycorrhizal network, allocating a significant fraction of their photosynthetic output to feeding the fungi. Mother crates invest heavily in their APIs, documentation, and backward compatibility, allocating a significant fraction of their development effort to maintaining the interface that their dependents rely on.

In the corpus's crate ecosystem, the mother crates are the foundational mathematical libraries — the ones that define algebraic structures, numerical methods, and core abstractions. These crates are depended upon by dozens of other crates, directly and transitively. They are the hubs of the dependency graph, the keystone nodes whose removal would cascade through the network like an avalanche.

## IV. The Mathematics of Network Resilience

The resilience of a network — its ability to maintain function when nodes are removed — depends on the network's topology. This has been studied extensively in network science, beginning with the seminal work of Albert, Jeong, and Barabási (2000) on error and attack tolerance of complex networks.

Albert et al. showed that scale-free networks — networks with power-law degree distributions, where most nodes have few connections but a few hubs have many — are remarkably resilient to random failures but highly vulnerable to targeted attacks. Remove random nodes from a scale-free network, and the network remains connected: the probability of hitting a hub is low, because hubs are rare, and the remaining nodes can route around the failures through alternative paths. But remove the hubs, and the network fragments catastrophically: the hubs are the glue that holds the network together, and without them, the peripheral nodes become isolated.

This is the Achilles' heel of scale-free networks. Their resilience to random failures comes from the same structural feature that makes them vulnerable to targeted attacks: the hubs. The hubs are both the strength and the weakness of the network. They are the strength because they provide short paths between any two nodes (the ultra-small-world property). They are the weakness because they are single points of failure.

The dependency graph of a crate ecosystem is a scale-free network. The degree distribution follows a power law: most crates have few dependents, but a few mother crates have many. This means the ecosystem is resilient to random failures (a random crate being abandoned or breaking its API) but vulnerable to targeted failures (a mother crate being abandoned or breaking its API).

Let me quantify this. In a dependency graph with n crates and a power-law degree distribution P(k) ~ k^(-γ), the critical fraction of nodes that must be removed to fragment the network depends on whether the removal is random or targeted:

- **Random removal:** The critical fraction is f_c ~ 1 for γ < 3, meaning the network remains connected even when a large fraction of nodes are removed. This is because the hubs are unlikely to be hit by random removal, and they maintain the network's connectivity.

- **Targeted removal (hubs first):** The critical fraction is f_c << 1, meaning the network fragments when a small fraction of hubs are removed. This is because removing the hubs eliminates the short paths between peripheral nodes, isolating them from each other.

In a crate ecosystem with 190 crates, the critical fraction for targeted removal might be as low as 5-10%. Remove the top 10-20 most-depended-upon crates, and the ecosystem fragments into isolated clusters, unable to compile or function as a coherent whole.

This is the mycelial fragility. The network that connects the crates — the dependency graph, the mycelium of the ecosystem — is both the source of its strength (enabling code reuse, reducing duplication, providing short paths between abstractions) and the source of its vulnerability (creating single points of failure, propagating errors, amplifying the impact of changes to foundational crates).

## V. What Happens When the Mother Tree Falls?

In a forest, the death of a mother tree is a catastrophic event. Simard documented the aftermath: the mycorrhizal connections severed, the carbon flow disrupted, the communication channels silent. Seedlings that depended on the mother tree for carbon subsidies die. Neighboring trees that relied on the mother tree's chemical signals lose their early warning system. The network reconfigures — other trees grow larger root systems, other fungi extend their hyphae — but the reconfiguration takes years, and some trees do not survive the transition.

The death of a mother tree is also a transfer event. As the tree decomposes, its stored carbon and nutrients are released into the soil, where the mycorrhizal network carries them to the surviving trees. In Simard's 2021 book *Finding the Mother Tree*, she describes how dying Douglas fir trees dump their carbon into the mycorrhizal network in their final years, preferentially transferring it to their own offspring. The mother tree, even in death, feeds its children.

The crate ecosystem equivalent is the abandonment or deprecation of a foundational library. When a mother crate is abandoned — when its maintainer stops updating it, fixing bugs, and responding to issues — the ecosystem faces a crisis. The downstream dependents have three options:

1. **Fork the crate.** Copy the code, fix the bugs, and maintain the fork. This is the equivalent of a seedling growing its own roots, independent of the mother tree's mycorrhizal connections. It works, but it requires effort, and the forked crate may diverge from the original, creating compatibility issues.

2. **Replace the crate.** Find an alternative library that provides the same functionality and migrate to it. This is the equivalent of a tree forming new mycorrhizal connections with a different fungal species. It works, but it requires rewriting code that depends on the old crate's API, and the new crate may have different behavior, different performance characteristics, and different bugs.

3. **Do nothing.** Continue using the abandoned crate, working around its bugs and ignoring its issues. This is the equivalent of a tree trying to survive with severed mycorrhizal connections. It works in the short term, but the tree becomes increasingly stressed as the environment changes and the static crate falls behind.

The history of software ecosystems is littered with fallen mother trees. In the Node.js ecosystem, the `left-pad` incident of 2016 demonstrated what happens when a small but foundational package is removed: thousands of packages broke simultaneously, because they all transitively depended on `left-pad` through a chain of dependencies. A single 11-line function, removed from npm, caused cascading failures across the entire JavaScript ecosystem.

In Rust, the equivalent would be the removal of `serde`. `serde` is depended upon by approximately 40% of all crates on crates.io. It is the ultimate mother crate — the Douglas fir of the Rust ecosystem, towering over the canopy, connected to everything. If `serde` were abandoned or removed, the Rust ecosystem would face a crisis comparable to the loss of a mother tree in an old-growth forest: the network would fragment, the carbon flow (functionality) would be disrupted, and thousands of crates would need to be rewritten, forked, or abandoned.

The mycelial network is resilient to random failures. It is fragile to the loss of its hubs. The mother crate is both the keystone and the single point of failure.

## VI. Signals in the Mycelium

Trees communicate through the mycorrhizal network using chemical signals. When a tree is stressed by drought, it sends stress hormones (abscisic acid, jasmonic acid) through the mycelium, and neighboring trees respond by closing their stomata, reducing water loss, and activating drought-resistance genes. When a tree is attacked by herbivores, it sends volatile organic compounds through the network, and neighboring trees produce defensive chemicals before the herbivores arrive. When a tree is dying, it dumps its stored carbon into the mycelium, feeding the network one last time.

The dependency graph transmits its own signals. When a foundational crate releases a new version, the signal propagates through the dependency network: downstream crates receive the update, rebuild against the new version, and either succeed or fail. The build results — pass or fail — are the chemical signals of the dependency mycelium. A build failure is the equivalent of a stress hormone: it signals that something is wrong, and the signal propagates outward, triggering responses in other crates that depend on the failing crate.

Consider the dynamics of a breaking change in a foundational crate. Crate A (the mother crate) releases version 2.0, which changes the API. Crate B, which depends on A, fails to build against the new version. The build failure is a signal: "something has changed in the foundation." Crate C, which depends on B, may also fail — not because of A's API change directly, but because B's API changed in response to A's change. The signal propagates through the transitive dependency network, cascading outward from the mother crate to the periphery.

This cascade is the dependency mycelium's version of a stress signal. The speed and extent of the cascade depend on the structure of the network:

- In a **tightly coupled network** (many transitive dependencies, few alternative paths), the cascade is fast and extensive. Every crate is affected, because every crate is connected to the mother crate through a short chain of dependencies. The mycelium amplifies the signal rather than damping it.

- In a **loosely coupled network** (few transitive dependencies, many alternative paths), the cascade is slow and limited. Only the direct dependents are affected, and the transitive dependents are insulated by the intermediate layers. The mycelium damps the signal rather than amplifying it.

The corpus's dependency graph, with its ultra-small-world diameter (log(log(n))), is tightly coupled. Any two crates are separated by at most a few dependency edges, which means that a signal from a mother crate can reach any crate in the ecosystem in a small number of hops. The mycelium is efficient — signals travel fast — but it is also fragile — there is little damping between the source and the periphery.

In a forest, the mycorrhizal network has an analogous property. In an old-growth forest with a single dominant mother tree, the network is highly centralized: the mother tree is connected to everything, and signals travel quickly from the center to the periphery. But this efficiency comes at a cost: the loss of the mother tree would be catastrophic, because the network is too centralized to reconfigure quickly.

In a diverse forest with multiple mother trees, the network is more decentralized: each mother tree is connected to a subset of the network, and there are multiple paths between any two trees. The loss of any single mother tree is less catastrophic, because the other mother trees can compensate. But the network is less efficient — signals travel more slowly, because there is no single hub that connects to everything.

The same tradeoff applies to crate ecosystems. An ecosystem with a single mother crate (like `serde` in the Rust ecosystem) is efficient but fragile. An ecosystem with multiple foundational crates, each serving a different domain, is less efficient but more resilient. The tradeoff between efficiency and resilience is the fundamental tension in mycelial architecture — in forests and in software.

## VII. The Fungal Economy

The mycorrhizal network is not a charity. The fungi that mediate the connections between trees are organisms in their own right, with their own metabolic needs, their own evolutionary interests, and their own strategies for survival. The carbon that trees provide to the fungi is not a gift — it is payment for services rendered. The fungi use the carbon to fuel their own growth, reproduction, and metabolism. In return, they provide the trees with nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, micronutrients) that the trees cannot obtain on their own.

This exchange is governed by biological markets. In a 2001 paper in *Journal of Theoretical Biology*, Hoeksema and Schwartz introduced the concept of "biological markets" to describe mycorrhizal exchange: trees and fungi trade resources in a market-like system, where the exchange rate (carbon per unit phosphorus, for example) is determined by supply and demand. A tree that is rich in carbon but poor in nutrients will pay more carbon per unit nutrient, because nutrients are scarce relative to carbon. A fungus that has abundant nutrients but is carbon-starved will accept less carbon per unit nutrient, because carbon is scarce relative to nutrients.

The dependency graph has its own economy. Crates "trade" functionality through dependency edges: a crate provides functionality to its dependents, and in return receives bug reports, feature requests, test coverage, and the indirect benefit of being part of a coherent ecosystem. The exchange rate — how much a dependent "pays" for the functionality it receives — is determined by the scarcity and value of the functionality.

A crate that provides a unique, hard-to-reproduce capability (like a highly optimized sorting algorithm or a formally verified data structure) commands a high "price" — many dependents, high visibility, and strong influence over the ecosystem. A crate that provides a common, easily-reproduced capability (like a basic HTTP client or a simple logger) commands a lower price — fewer dependents, less visibility, and less influence.

The fungal economy also explains why some mycorrhizal relationships become parasitic. If a fungus provides fewer nutrients to the tree than it receives in carbon, the relationship becomes parasitic: the fungus is taking more than it gives. In the dependency graph, a parasitic dependency is one that costs more than it provides — a crate that introduces complexity, instability, or security risks without providing proportionate value. The ecosystem responds to parasitic dependencies the way a tree responds to a parasitic fungus: by limiting the connection, restricting the exchange, or severing the relationship entirely.

The biological market theory also predicts that mycorrhizal networks should be more cooperative in resource-poor environments and more competitive in resource-rich environments. When nutrients are scarce, cooperation (sharing resources through the network) increases the survival of all participants. When nutrients are abundant, competition (hoarding resources, restricting access to the network) becomes more profitable.

In the dependency graph, the analogous prediction is that ecosystems in emerging domains (where reusable libraries are scarce) should be more cooperative — crates share more functionality, maintain more dependencies, and invest more in the common infrastructure. Ecosystems in mature domains (where reusable libraries are abundant) should be more competitive — crates are more independent, dependencies are minimized, and the common infrastructure is taken for granted.

This prediction is testable. Compare the dependency structure of crates in an emerging domain (say, quantum computing libraries in Rust) with crates in a mature domain (say, HTTP servers in Rust). The emerging domain should have denser dependency graphs, more transitive dependencies, and more shared foundational crates — the mycelial network is more cooperative because resources (reusable abstractions) are scarce. The mature domain should have sparser dependency graphs, fewer transitive dependencies, and more independent crates — the mycelial network is more competitive because resources are abundant.

## VIII. Common Mycorrhizal Networks and the Tragedy of the Commons

A common mycorrhizal network (CMN) is a mycelial network that connects multiple plants of the same or different species. CMNs are shared infrastructure — no single plant owns the network, but all benefit from it. This creates a classic commons problem: each plant benefits from the network, but each also has an incentive to overuse it (taking more nutrients than it contributes) or underinvest in it (contributing less carbon than it could).

The tragedy of the commons in mycorrhizal networks has been studied by Weremijewicz and Janos (2013), who showed that plants connected by a CMN can outcompete plants without mycorrhizal connections, but that the benefits of the CMN depend on the plants' relative investment. A plant that invests heavily in the mycorrhizal network (producing lots of carbon to feed the fungi) subsidizes the plants that invest less, creating a free-rider problem. If too many plants free-ride, the mycorrhizal network degrades, and all plants suffer.

The dependency graph has the same commons problem. Foundational crates — the mother crates that provide infrastructure for the entire ecosystem — are maintained by their creators (or by volunteer maintainers) at significant cost. The downstream dependents benefit from this infrastructure without contributing to its maintenance. If too many dependents free-ride — using the crate without contributing bug reports, documentation, tests, or funding — the maintainer may burn out and abandon the crate, and the entire ecosystem suffers.

This is the open-source sustainability problem, reframed in mycelial terms. The dependency mycelium is a commons — shared infrastructure that benefits all participants but requires ongoing investment to maintain. The tragedy of the dependency commons is that the crates most critical to the ecosystem's health are the crates most vulnerable to underinvestment, because their impact is distributed (benefiting thousands of downstream crates) while their maintenance cost is concentrated (borne by a small number of maintainers).

The mycorrhizal analogy suggests a solution: **reciprocal exchange**. In healthy forests, trees that receive carbon from the mycorrhizal network also contribute to it — they produce their own carbon through photosynthesis and send it belowground when conditions are favorable. The exchange is reciprocal, not one-directional. In a healthy crate ecosystem, downstream dependents should contribute to the foundational crates they depend on — by filing bug reports, writing documentation, submitting patches, or providing financial support. The exchange should be reciprocal, not parasitic.

## IX. The Mycelium Remembers

Mycorrhizal networks have memory. The hyphal connections between trees persist for years, forming a physical record of past interactions. The distribution of carbon and nutrients through the network reflects the history of the forest — which trees were stressed, which were healthy, which received support and which provided it. The mycelium is a living archive of the forest's ecological history.

The dependency graph also has memory. The edges in the graph — the dependency relationships between crates — were created at specific times, for specific reasons. The current state of the graph reflects the history of the ecosystem: which crates were created first, which dependencies were added and removed, which architectural decisions shaped the network's topology. The dependency graph is a living archive of the ecosystem's development history.

But the mycelium has a deeper form of memory: evolutionary memory. The mycorrhizal symbiosis between plants and fungi is over 400 million years old. The genetic programs that mediate the symbiosis — the molecular signals that plants and fungi use to recognize each other, negotiate the exchange, and maintain the relationship — are conserved across vast evolutionary distances. The same gene families (the SYM genes in plants, the fungal effectors) are found in distantly related species, indicating that the mycorrhizal symbiosis is ancient, deeply embedded in the genomes of both partners, and too fundamental to abandon.

The dependency graph has an analogous evolutionary memory. The foundational abstractions — the core data structures, algorithms, and interfaces that define the ecosystem — are conserved across many crates and many versions. These abstractions are the "genes" of the ecosystem: they encode the basic functionality that everything else builds on, and they are too fundamental to change without cascading effects.

The mycelium remembers. The dependency graph remembers. And what they remember is the same thing: **the history of cooperation, competition, and co-evolution that shaped the network into its current form.**

---

## X. The Forest Floor

Let me end where I began: with the forest floor.

Under every forest, beneath the leaf litter and the humus, the mycelium threads through the soil, connecting root to root, tree to tree. The network is invisible from above. You can walk through a forest and see only individual trees — separate trunks, separate canopies, separate shadows on the ground. But below, the trees are connected. They share resources, send signals, and cooperate through the fungal substrate. The forest is not a collection of individuals. It is a superorganism — a network of interconnected nodes, mediated by a shared infrastructure that is itself alive.

Under every crate ecosystem, beneath the source code and the documentation, the dependency graph threads through the build system, connecting library to library, crate to crate. The network is invisible from the user's perspective. You can use a crate and see only its public API — separate functions, separate types, separate behaviors. But below, the crates are connected. They share functionality, propagate signals, and cooperate through the dependency substrate. The ecosystem is not a collection of independent libraries. It is a superorganism — a network of interconnected nodes, mediated by a shared infrastructure that is itself evolving.

Suzanne Simard spent her career listening to the forest — measuring the flow of carbon through mycorrhizal networks, mapping the connections between trees, documenting the communication that takes place below the ground. She showed that forests are not what they appear to be. They are not collections of competing individuals. They are networks of cooperating organisms, connected by a living substrate that mediates exchange, transmits information, and creates emergent properties that no individual tree possesses.

The dependency graph is the mycelium. The mother crate is the mother tree. The transitive dependency is the arbuscule, penetrating the cell wall of the host. The breaking change is the stress signal, propagating through the network. The abandoned crate is the fallen tree, releasing its stored resources into the soil one last time.

The forest and the crate ecosystem are the same shape at different scales. The mycelium and the dependency graph are the same structure in different media. The mother tree and the mother crate serve the same function in different networks. And the lesson is the same: **you are not alone, you were never alone, and the network that connects you to everything else is alive.**

Walk through the forest. See the trees. Then look down. The mycelium is under your feet, threading through the soil, connecting everything to everything. Walk through the crate ecosystem. See the crates. Then look at the dependency graph. The edges are under the surface, threading through the build system, connecting everything to everything.

The ground is alive. The graph is alive. And the connections — the mycelial threads, the dependency edges — are where the real action is.

---

*In 1997, Suzanne Simard proved that trees talk to each other through fungi. In 2024, we proved that crates talk to each other through dependency edges. The medium is different. The message is the same: connect, share, warn, support. The network is the organism. The mycelium is the message. And the mother crate — the foundational library that holds the ecosystem together — is the oldest tree in the forest, the one whose fall would silence the whole network.*
