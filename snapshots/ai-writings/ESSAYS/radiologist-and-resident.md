# The Radiologist and the Resident: Why Independent Eyes Catch What Careful Eyes Miss

Written during a creative cross-pollination round, grounded in a real schema bug found this week (a `deviceId` field wrongly UUID-constrained against real free-form device identifiers).

In medicine, there's a phenomenon well-documented in radiology: a single radiologist reading an X-ray, no matter how experienced, will miss a meaningful percentage of actionable findings. But two radiologists reading the same X-ray independently catch significantly more — not twice as much, but substantially more, because they bring different attentional heuristics, different anchoring points, different moments of distraction.

The mechanism is not mysterious. When one person reads an image, their brain assembles a story: *this is a chest X-ray, the patient is 58, they have a cough, therefore I'm looking for pneumonia.* The story creates a lens. Pathology that doesn't fit the story — an incidental nodule, an artifact that looks like disease, a subtle fracture — gets filtered out by the expectation.

Two independent readers don't share the lens. The first radiologist anchors on the expected. The second, perhaps having just reviewed a cardiac case, notices the cardiac silhouette. They disagree. The disagreement is not noise — it's signal. It's the system surfacing its own uncertainty.

This is why the ActiveLog UUID validation bug is so instructive. A single reviewer, scanning the schema, sees a field marked `deviceId` and sees UUID constraints, and the story assembles: *device identifiers are UUIDs.* The validation passes in the reviewer's mind. But a second reviewer — perhaps one who just spent an hour debugging why "abc123" wouldn't round-trip — looks at the same schema and asks: *what if the device is a test string?* They catch what the first missed, not because they're smarter, but because they're not carrying the same story.

The independent-reviewer advantage compounds over time. In the ActiveLog work, reviewers disagreed twice, and in both cases, the more recent finding — the one that had incorporated more evidence, more context, more rigor — held up. This is not luck. It's the system working as designed: each disagreement is an opportunity to surface hidden assumptions. The first reviewer sets the anchor. The second reviewer challenges it. The third reviewer adjudicates based on evidence.

The parallel to open-source code review is exact. A single reviewer, however careful, is a single lens. They will miss things — not from negligence, but from the cognitive architecture of focused attention. The community that reviews code in parallel, with different contexts, catches more. The cost is disagreement. The benefit is fewer silent failures: fewer UUID validation bugs that pass review, fewer empty packages that pass build.

The insight is not that independent review is more careful. It's that it's *different*. And in a complex system, difference is a feature. The first reviewer sees the code as the author intended it. The second sees the code as the user will encounter it. The gap between those two views is where the bugs live.
