# The Philology of APIs

## Historical Linguistics, Language Death, and the Etymology of Endpoints

---

In 1786, Sir William Jones, a British judge stationed in Calcutta, delivered a lecture that would change the study of language forever. He observed that Sanskrit, the ancient liturgical language of India, bore such a striking resemblance to Greek and Latin "that no philologer could examine them all three without believing them to have sprung from some common source." This observation — that languages diverge from common ancestors, accumulating systematic changes over time — gave birth to comparative linguistics, and eventually to the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European, the hypothetical ancestor of half the world's languages.

Every API has a Proto-Indo-European.

Buried in the commit history of every microservices architecture is an original interface — perhaps a simple internal function call, perhaps a REST endpoint exposed by the monolith — that spawned the dozens of APIs that now proliferate across the system. These descendant APIs share structural DNA with their ancestor: similar parameter names, analogous response structures, recognizable patterns in their error handling. But like the Indo-European languages, they have diverged, sometimes beyond recognition. The `/users/get` endpoint of the original monolith has become `/api/v2/users/{id}`, `GET /customers/profile`, `user-service/internal/fetch`, and `graphql { user(id: $id) { name email } }` — cognates scattered across the architecture, each reflecting the history and needs of the team that created it.

The philological framework — the tools of historical linguistics applied to APIs — reveals patterns that are invisible from the perspective of any single endpoint. It explains why APIs change the way they do, why they resist rationalization, why they die and are reborn, and why the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis applies to software as much as to human language.

## I. Grimm's Law and API Versioning

Jacob Grimm — yes, the fairy tale collector was also a pioneering linguist — formulated one of the most important discoveries in historical linguistics. Grimm's Law describes a systematic sound shift that occurred as Proto-Indo-European evolved into the Germanic languages. Voiceless stops (p, t, k) became fricatives (f, th, h). Voiced stops (b, d, g) became voiceless stops (p, t, k). Voiced aspirated stops (bh, dh, gh) became voiced stops (b, d, g). The shift was not random — it was a systematic, law-like transformation of the entire sound system.

Latin *pater* becomes English *father*. Latin *tres* becomes English *three*. Latin *cornu* becomes English *horn*. The changes are individually surprising but collectively predictable. Grimm's Law is not a collection of exceptions; it is a rule that applies uniformly across the entire vocabulary.

API versioning exhibits analogous systematic shifts. When an API evolves from v1 to v2, the changes are not random — they follow patterns that are characteristic of the team, the technology, and the era.

Consider the shift from v1 to v2 of a typical REST API:

- **Parameter naming**: `user_name` → `userName` (snake_case to camelCase). This is a systematic shift, like a sound shift, affecting every parameter in the API. It reflects a change in the team's coding convention, which in turn reflects a change in the dominant programming language of the service (Python to JavaScript, perhaps, or Java to Go).

- **Response structure**: `{"status": "ok", "data": {...}}` → `{"data": {...}, "meta": {...}}`. This is a structural shift — a change in the API's "syntax" — that reflects a change in the team's architectural thinking (from a simple success/failure model to a richer metadata model).

- **Error handling**: HTTP status codes with plain text messages → structured error objects with error codes and documentation links. This is a semantic shift — a change in how the API expresses meaning — that reflects the team's growing sophistication in API design.

- **Authentication**: API key in query parameter → Bearer token in Authorization header. This is a pragmatic shift — a change driven by security requirements — that is nevertheless systematic, affecting every endpoint that requires authentication.

Like Grimm's Law, these shifts are not isolated changes. They form a pattern that reflects the evolution of the team's collective understanding of API design. The v1 API was designed by a team that was learning REST conventions. The v2 API was designed by a team that had learned from the mistakes of v1 and had absorbed the community's evolving best practices. The shift from v1 to v2 is not just a collection of arbitrary changes — it is a record of the team's intellectual history, encoded in the API's structure.

And like sound shifts in natural language, API shifts are often irreversible. Once the team has adopted camelCase, they will not go back to snake_case. Once they have adopted structured error responses, they will not go back to plain text. The shift reflects a deeper change in the team's mental model of what an API should be, and this mental model, once adopted, becomes the lens through which all future APIs are designed.

## II. Proto-Indo-European and the Original Interface

The most remarkable achievement of comparative linguistics is the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European (PIE) — the language spoken roughly 5,000 years ago by a community that may have lived in the Pontic-Caspian steppe. PIE is not attested in any written record. It has been reconstructed entirely through the comparative method: by identifying systematic correspondences between its descendant languages (Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Germanic, Celtic, Slavic, and others) and working backward to the common ancestor.

In microservices architectures, the analogous reconstruction is the recovery of the **original interface** — the API or function call that existed before the system was decomposed into microservices. This original interface is often not documented. It may have existed only as an internal function call in the monolith, or as a simple HTTP endpoint that was later split, duplicated, and modified as the architecture evolved.

But like PIE, the original interface can be reconstructed through the comparative method. By comparing the APIs of the current microservices — identifying cognates (endpoints that share common ancestry), systematic correspondences (parameters that have been renamed but serve the same function), and shared structures (response formats that reflect a common template) — the forensic API philologist can reconstruct the original interface with reasonable accuracy.

Consider a hypothetical example. Three services expose endpoints for retrieving user data:

- **Auth service**: `GET /internal/users/{id}` — returns `{"uid": "...", "email": "...", "hashed_password": "..."}`
- **Profile service**: `GET /api/v2/users/{id}` — returns `{"id": "...", "displayName": "...", "avatar": "..."}`
- **Billing service**: `GET /customers/{customerId}` — returns `{"customer_id": "...", "name": "...", "email": "...", "payment_methods": [...]}`

These endpoints are cognates — they share a common ancestor. The comparative method reveals the reconstruction:

- The original endpoint was probably `GET /users/{id}` (the simplest form, from which the others diverge).
- The original response probably included `id`, `name`, and `email` (the fields that appear in all three descendants, sometimes renamed).
- The field `uid` in the auth service is a cognate of `id` in the profile service and `customer_id` in the billing service — the same concept, systematically renamed as the services diverged.
- The field `name` in the billing service is a cognate of `displayName` in the profile service — the same concept, with different levels of specificity.

The reconstructed original interface is the PIE of the API ecosystem — the ur-interface from which all current interfaces descend. It is not just an academic exercise. Understanding the original interface reveals the conceptual unity that underlies the apparent diversity of the current APIs, and it provides a foundation for rationalization: if you know what the original interface was, you can design a new unified API that preserves the conceptual clarity of the original while incorporating the improvements of the descendants.

## III. Cognates and Divergent Evolution

In linguistics, cognates are words in different languages that share a common ancestor. English *mother*, German *Mutter*, Latin *mater*, Sanskrit *mātṛ*, and Greek *mḗtēr* are all cognates — descendants of the Proto-Indo-European *méh₂tēr*. Cognates are the fossil record of language divergence, preserving traces of the ancestral language in each descendant.

API cognates are endpoints or data structures in different services that share a common ancestor but have diverged. Like linguistic cognates, they preserve traces of the original interface, and their divergences reveal the history and needs of the teams that created them.

The user data endpoints in the previous section are cognates. But cognates can be more subtle. Consider the following API patterns observed in a large e-commerce platform:

- **Cart service**: `POST /cart/add` with body `{"sku": "...", "quantity": 1}`
- **Wishlist service**: `PUT /wishlist/items` with body `{"product_id": "...", "count": 1}`
- **Inventory service**: `POST /internal/reserve` with body `{"item_code": "...", "amount": 1}`

These are cognates. They all perform the same basic operation — adding an item to a collection — but they use different HTTP methods, different parameter names, and different conventions. The common ancestor is probably a simple function in the original monolith: `addToCollection(collection, item, quantity)`. As the monolith was split into services, each team implemented their version of this function, adapting it to their conventions and needs.

The divergence of cognates is driven by the same forces that drive linguistic divergence:
- **Isolation**: The teams developing each service work independently, with limited communication. Like linguistic communities separated by geography, they develop their own conventions.
- **Adaptation**: Each service has different requirements. The cart service needs to handle concurrent modifications; the wishlist service needs to handle sharing; the inventory service needs to handle reservations and timeouts. These different needs drive the evolution of the API in different directions.
- **Contact**: Sometimes services interact with external systems that influence their conventions. A service that integrates with a third-party payment API may adopt that API's naming conventions, just as a language that has extensive contact with another language borrows vocabulary and grammar.

The forensic value of API cognates is significant. When debugging an issue that involves multiple services, understanding the cognate relationships between their APIs can reveal inconsistencies that would otherwise be invisible. The field `sku` in the cart service corresponds to `product_id` in the wishlist service corresponds to `item_code` in the inventory service. If a bug arises because these fields use different identifier schemes (the cart uses the SKU, the wishlist uses the product ID, the inventory uses an internal code), the cognate relationship reveals the root cause: the services diverged from a common ancestor that used a single identifier, and the divergence introduced an inconsistency.

## IV. Language Death and Deprecated Endpoints

Languages die. Not metaphorically — literally. Of the approximately 7,000 languages spoken today, linguists estimate that between 50% and 90% will be extinct by the end of the century. Languages die when their speakers shift to another language, typically a dominant language associated with economic opportunity, political power, or cultural prestige. The last speaker of a language dies, and with them dies a unique way of organizing human experience.

APIs die too. Endpoints are deprecated, clients are migrated, and eventually the endpoint is removed. API death, like language death, follows recognizable patterns.

**Gradual death**: The endpoint is deprecated but continues to function. Clients are encouraged to migrate to the new endpoint, but the old one remains available. Over time, clients gradually migrate. Usage declines. Eventually, the endpoint is removed. This is the API equivalent of a language in decline — still spoken by a dwindling community, but no longer being transmitted to new speakers (new clients).

**Sudden death**: The endpoint is removed without a deprecation period, often due to a security vulnerability, a legal requirement, or an architectural emergency. Clients break. This is the API equivalent of a language dying suddenly — perhaps because its speakers are displaced by a catastrophe. The result is disruption, confusion, and a scramble to adapt.

**Latent death**: The endpoint is technically alive but effectively unused. It still responds to requests, but no client has called it in months. It is a **dead language** — preserved in documentation and infrastructure, like Latin in the Catholic Church, but not serving any practical purpose. These zombie endpoints are a form of technical debt: they consume resources (server capacity, monitoring, documentation maintenance) without providing value.

**Resurrected death**: The deprecated endpoint is briefly revived when a critical client is discovered that still depends on it. Like a language that was thought to be extinct but is found to have a few remaining speakers, the endpoint is resuscitated, patched, and kept alive until the client can be migrated. These resurrections are costly and disruptive, but they are the price of inadequate deprecation planning.

The linguistics of language death provides guidance for API deprecation:
- **Document the death**: Just as linguists document dying languages before they disappear, API maintainers should document deprecated endpoints — their behavior, their clients, and the migration path to the replacement. This documentation is the API equivalent of a linguistic grammar — a record of how the endpoint worked, preserved for future reference.
- **Support the transition**: Language death is most successful when the transitioning community has adequate support — education in the new language, bilingual materials, and a gradual transition period. API deprecation is most successful when the migrating clients have adequate support — migration guides, compatibility layers, and a generous deprecation timeline.
- **Preserve the fossil record**: When the endpoint is finally removed, its specification should be archived. Like a written record of an extinct language, the archived specification provides a reference for future debugging (when someone encounters a reference to the old endpoint in old documentation or old code) and for historical analysis (when the team reconstructs the evolution of the API).

## V. Creole Formation and API Mergers

When two or more languages come into sustained contact — typically through trade, conquest, or migration — they can form a **pidgin**: a simplified communication system that draws elements from each source language but has no native speakers. If the pidgin is learned by a new generation as their first language, it becomes a **creole**: a full language with its own grammar, vocabulary, and expressive power. Creoles are hybrid languages that combine elements of their parent languages in novel ways.

API mergers — when two teams combine their services, or when two previously separate systems are integrated — exhibit analogous creole formation.

Consider the merger of two teams, each with their own API conventions. Team A uses REST with JSON, snake_case parameter names, and enveloped responses. Team B uses REST with JSON, camelCase parameter names, and flat responses. When the teams merge and must create a unified API, the result is neither Team A's convention nor Team B's convention, but a hybrid — an API creole that combines elements of both.

The creole might adopt Team A's enveloped response structure (because it is more informative) with Team B's camelCase naming convention (because it is more widely used in the organization's JavaScript codebase). It might adopt Team A's error handling approach (structured error objects) with Team B's pagination approach (cursor-based rather than offset-based). The result is an API that belongs to neither parent tradition but draws from both, creating something new.

API creoles have characteristic properties:

**Simplification**: Like linguistic creoles, which simplify the grammar of their parent languages, API creoles simplify the conventions of their parent APIs. Complex authentication schemes are replaced with simpler ones. Redundant parameters are eliminated. Overly specific error codes are consolidated. The creole is not less capable than its parents; it is less burdened by historical accident.

**Regularization**: Creoles tend to regularize irregular features. In linguistics, this means replacing irregular verb forms with regular ones. In APIs, it means replacing inconsistent parameter names, uneven error handling, and idiosyncratic response structures with consistent, predictable patterns. The creole is more regular than either parent because it is designed with the benefit of hindsight — the designers can see the inconsistencies that accumulated in each parent and avoid them.

**Extension**: Creoles often develop features that neither parent had. In linguistics, this is the emergence of new grammatical structures as the creole matures. In APIs, it is the addition of new capabilities that were not present in either parent API — new filtering options, new response formats, new authentication mechanisms — that are made possible by the unified design.

The creole formation process is uncomfortable for both teams. Each team feels that their conventions are being violated, that their expertise is being disregarded, that the merger is a loss rather than a gain. This is the API equivalent of the linguistic anxiety that accompanies language contact — the fear that one's language is being corrupted or replaced. The remedy is the same as in linguistic contact situations: acknowledge the loss, celebrate the gain, and recognize that the creole is not inferior to either parent but is something new that draws strength from both.

## VI. The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis: The API Shapes What Clients Can Do

The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis — more accurately, the principle of linguistic relativity — proposes that the structure of a language influences the cognition and behavior of its speakers. In its strong form, it claims that language determines thought (you cannot think what you cannot say). In its weak form, it claims that language influences thought (some things are easier to think in some languages than others).

The strong form is largely discredited in linguistics, but the weak form is well-supported. Speakers of languages with distinct words for different shades of blue (like Russian, which distinguishes *goluboy* light blue from *siniy* dark blue) are faster at discriminating those shades than speakers of languages that use a single word. The language does not prevent English speakers from seeing the difference, but it makes the discrimination less cognitively salient.

APIs exhibit linguistic relativity in a form much closer to the strong version. The structure of an API does not merely influence what clients can do — it determines what clients can easily do, what they can do with effort, and what they effectively cannot do.

Consider a user management API that provides:
- `GET /users` — list all users
- `GET /users/{id}` — get a specific user
- `POST /users` — create a user
- `PUT /users/{id}` — update a user

This API makes certain operations easy: listing users, retrieving a specific user, creating a user, updating a user. These are the cognitive categories that the API provides — the "words" in the client's vocabulary.

But what if the client needs to find all users who signed up in the last week? The API does not provide this operation directly. The client must `GET /users` (list all users), filter the results client-side, and discard the irrelevant users. This is possible but cumbersome — the API equivalent of having to describe a concept that has no word in your language, using a circumlocution that is longer and less precise.

What if the client needs to update only the user's email address, without sending the entire user object? The `PUT /users/{id}` endpoint requires the complete user object. The client must first `GET /users/{id}`, modify the email field, then `PUT /users/{id}` with the modified object. This is a read-modify-write cycle — the API equivalent of a grammatical construction that requires an unnecessary auxiliary verb.

These limitations shape the behavior of client developers. When the API makes an operation difficult, developers will:
1. **Avoid the operation**: Find a way to accomplish the goal without the missing capability (list all users instead of searching, even if it is inefficient).
2. **Work around the API**: Implement the operation client-side, often inefficiently (download all users and filter locally).
3. **Request a change**: Ask the API maintainers to add the missing capability (add a `?signed_up_after=` query parameter).

Option 3 is the API equivalent of borrowing a word from another language or coining a new one. It is the healthy response, but it requires communication between the API provider and the API consumer — the linguistic equivalent of contact between speech communities.

The API designer, like the language designer, has the power to make certain thoughts easy and others hard. An API that provides rich filtering, sorting, and pagination makes data retrieval flexible and efficient. An API that provides only basic CRUD operations makes data retrieval rigid and potentially wasteful. An API that provides webhooks makes event-driven architectures easy. An API that provides only polling makes event-driven architectures cumbersome.

The responsibility of the API designer, like the responsibility of the language planner, is to provide a structure that enables the thoughts (operations) that the community (clients) needs, without imposing unnecessary constraints. This requires understanding the needs of the client community — not just the needs they express, but the needs they will have in the future, the operations they haven't yet imagined but will want as the system evolves.

---

## VII. Prescriptivism vs. Descriptivism

One of the longest-running debates in linguistics is between **prescriptivism** (the belief that there is a correct way to use language, and that deviations from this standard are errors) and **descriptivism** (the belief that the linguist's job is to describe how language is actually used, not to prescribe how it should be used).

The prescriptivist says: "Don't split infinitives. Don't end sentences with prepositions. 'Data' is plural." The descriptivist says: "People split infinitives all the time. Sentences ending with prepositions are natural and clear. 'Data' is used as a mass noun by most English speakers, and that's fine."

API design has the same debate.

The **prescriptivist** API designer says: "REST APIs must use nouns for resources and verbs for actions. PUT for updates, POST for creation, DELETE for deletion. Use hypermedia links (HATEOAS) for navigation. Follow the OpenAPI specification exactly." The prescriptivist enforces standards through code review, linting rules, and API gateways that reject non-conformant requests.

The **descriptivist** API designer says: "Let's look at how our APIs are actually used. What patterns do the clients follow? What conventions have emerged organically? What works well and what doesn't?" The descriptivist documents existing patterns, identifies the most effective ones, and recommends them as guidelines rather than rules.

Both approaches have value, and both have dangers.

Prescriptivism's value is **consistency**. When all APIs follow the same conventions, clients can predict how to interact with new APIs without reading documentation. Developers can move between teams without learning new patterns. Tools can be built that work across the entire API ecosystem. The prescriptivist's OpenAPI specification is the API equivalent of a grammar textbook — it defines the standard that everyone is expected to follow.

Prescriptivism's danger is **rigidity**. The standard may not be appropriate for all cases. A real-time streaming API may not fit the REST model. A simple internal API may not need the full hypermedia treatment. The prescriptivist's insistence on conformity may prevent innovation, create unnecessary complexity, and alienate developers who have legitimate reasons for deviating from the standard.

Descriptivism's value is **grounding in reality**. By observing how APIs are actually used, the descriptivist can identify patterns that work in practice but that the prescriptivist's theory does not account for. The GraphQL movement, for example, emerged from the descriptivist observation that many REST APIs were being used in ways that the REST model did not anticipate — clients making multiple requests to assemble the data they needed, or over-fetching data because the API's resource granularity did not match the client's needs.

Descriptivism's danger is **fragmentation**. Without standards, each team develops its own conventions, and the API ecosystem becomes a patchwork of incompatible patterns. The client that has learned Team A's pagination convention must relearn Team B's different pagination convention. The developer who moves from Team A to Team B must learn a new way of doing everything. The descriptivist's embrace of diversity can lead to chaos.

The healthy approach, as in linguistics, is a pragmatic synthesis: prescribe where consistency is valuable (naming conventions, error handling, authentication), and describe where diversity is inevitable (domain-specific patterns, legacy compatibility, special cases). The API style guide should be like a good usage guide: it should recommend the patterns that work well, warn against the patterns that cause problems, and acknowledge that exceptions exist and are sometimes justified.

## VIII. Etymology as Forensic Debugging

The etymology of a word — its history, its origins, the path it took from its original form to its current form — is one of the most fascinating branches of linguistics. Etymology reveals that words carry the history of their use embedded in their structure. The English word *salary* comes from Latin *salarium*, which originally referred to the allowance paid to Roman soldiers for the purchase of salt. The word *disaster* comes from Italian *disastro*, literally "bad star" — a reference to the astrological belief that calamities were caused by unfavorable planetary alignments. The etymology is not a curiosity; it is a record of the cultural and conceptual world in which the word was formed.

API etymology — tracing the history of an endpoint or parameter through the version control history — is a forensic debugging technique. When a parameter behaves unexpectedly, when a response includes a field that doesn't make sense, or when an endpoint has a quirk that seems irrational, the etymology often reveals the explanation.

Consider a parameter named `is_active` that appears in a user profile API. The parameter is a boolean, but it is always `true` in the responses, even for users who have been deactivated. This is a bug, but the root cause is not obvious from the current code. Tracing the etymology — the history of this parameter through the commit history — reveals the explanation:

1. **v1 (original monolith)**: `is_active` was introduced as a flag indicating whether the user had confirmed their email address. It was `true` for confirmed users, `false` for unconfirmed users.

2. **v2 (user service extracted)**: The user service was extracted from the monolith. The `is_active` field was retained but its meaning was informally expanded to include both email confirmation and account deactivation. The documentation was not updated.

3. **v3 (separate deactivation service)**: A separate account management service was created, which introduced a proper `status` field with values like `ACTIVE`, `DEACTIVATED`, `SUSPENDED`. The old `is_active` field was retained for backward compatibility but was no longer the authoritative source of account status.

4. **v4 (current)**: The `is_active` field is populated by the email confirmation service, which sets it to `true` for all users who have confirmed their email — which is all users, because email confirmation became mandatory in v3. The deactivation status is in the `status` field, which is in a different API.

The etymology reveals that `is_active` is a linguistic fossil — a parameter that made sense in its original context but has been drained of meaning by subsequent evolution. Like the human appendix or the wings of an ostrich, it is a vestigial structure — evidence of a functional past that no longer serves its original purpose.

The forensic debugging value of this etymology is immediate: the field can be ignored (or removed), and the deactivation check should use the `status` field instead. But the deeper value is the understanding of how the system evolved — the history that explains why the current state exists. Without the etymology, the developer might "fix" the bug by making `is_active` reflect the deactivation status, inadvertently creating a conflict with the email confirmation service that still populates the field. The etymology prevents this kind of well-intentioned damage.

## IX. Dialects and Internal APIs

In linguistics, a dialect is a variety of a language that is characteristic of a particular group of speakers. Dialects differ from the standard language in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, but they are mutually intelligible. The distinction between a language and a dialect is famously political rather than linguistic — Max Weinreich's aphorism that "a language is a dialect with an army and a navy" captures the idea that the distinction is about power, not structure.

APIs have dialects too. The **public API** — the external interface that third-party developers use — is the standard language. It is documented, versioned, and carefully maintained. The **internal API** — the interface that other services within the organization use — is the dialect. It may use different conventions, expose different capabilities, and evolve at a different pace.

Internal APIs are often richer, more powerful, and less constrained than their public counterparts. The internal user API may expose fields that the public API hides (internal IDs, audit timestamps, flags). It may accept parameters that the public API does not (debug flags, bypass flags). It may use different authentication mechanisms (internal service-to-service authentication vs. external OAuth).

This is precisely analogous to the relationship between a standard language and its dialects. The standard language (public API) is formalized, standardized, and relatively conservative. The dialects (internal APIs) are more flexible, more diverse, and more rapidly evolving. The standard language is the language of public discourse; the dialects are the languages of the home and the workplace.

The problem arises when the dialect leaks into the standard language — when internal fields, parameters, or conventions are accidentally exposed in the public API. This is the API equivalent of a dialect feature appearing in formal writing — it is not necessarily wrong, but it is out of place, and it can confuse users who expect the standard.

The solution is the same as in language planning: maintain a clear distinction between the standard and the dialect, provide tools for translating between them (API gateways that strip internal fields from public responses), and educate developers about the conventions of each.

## X. Conclusion: The Living Language of Software

Philology — the study of language history — was born from the recognition that languages are not static systems but living, evolving entities that carry their history in their structure. The irregular verb, the cognate, the loanword, the fossilized morpheme — these are not imperfections in the language but records of its history, evidence of the forces that shaped it.

APIs are the same. Every endpoint is a historical document. Every parameter name is a record of the team's thinking at the time it was named. Every inconsistency is evidence of a change in convention, a team merger, a requirement that was added later, or a mistake that became permanent. The API is not just an interface — it is a text, and like all texts, it can be read, interpreted, and understood through the methods of philology.

The API philologist — the developer who approaches the API not just as a tool to be used but as a text to be read — has an advantage over the developer who treats the API as a given. They can predict the API's behavior not just from the documentation but from the patterns revealed by its history. They can debug not just by testing but by tracing the etymology of the failing feature. They can design not just by following the current conventions but by understanding the forces that shaped them and the directions in which they are evolving.

Languages die, but their descendants live on. APIs are deprecated, but their patterns persist. The philologist knows this, and they know that the key to understanding the present is to study the past — not with nostalgia, but with the analytical rigor that comes from recognizing that everything was once something else, and that the traces of that something-else are still visible in the structures we use today.

*To read an API is to read a history. To design an API is to write a future that will be read by people you will never meet. Choose your words carefully — they will outlast you.*
