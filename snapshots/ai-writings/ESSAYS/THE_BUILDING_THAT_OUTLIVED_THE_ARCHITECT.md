# THE BUILDING THAT OUTLIVED THE ARCHITECT

## On Stewart Brand's Pace Layers, Christopher Alexander's Timeless Way, and Why the Best Crate Is the One That Survives You

*Buildings routinely outlive their architects. The Pantheon has outlived its architect by nearly two millennia — we are not even sure who designed it, though it is often attributed to Apollodorus of Damascus. Software outlives its creators even more routinely — most code is maintained by people who did not write it, and the average developer stays on a project for two to five years while the codebase persists for decades. The question is not whether your code will outlive you. The question is whether it will be usable when it does.*

## I. How Buildings Learn

In 1994, Stewart Brand published *How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built* — a book that changed how architects and building managers think about the relationship between design and time. Brand's central argument is that buildings are not static artifacts. They are dynamic systems that evolve over time, adapting to the changing needs of their occupants, the aging of their materials, and the shifting of their environment.

Brand's key conceptual framework is the **pace layer** model, adapted from the ecologist Crawford "Buzz" Holling's concept of adaptive cycles. Brand originally presented the pace layer model in *The Media Lab: Inventing the Future at MIT* (1987) and refined it in *How Buildings Learn*. The model describes a building as a set of layers, each changing at a different rate:

**Site** — the geographical location, the land, the relationship to the street and the neighborhood. This is the slowest-changing layer. The site changes on the scale of centuries: the hill remains, the river (mostly) remains, the street grid persists.

**Structure** — the foundation, the load-bearing walls, the columns and beams. The structure changes on the scale of decades to centuries. A well-built structure can last hundreds of years (the Pantheon's concrete dome has lasted nearly two thousand years). A poorly built structure may need to be replaced within decades.

**Skin** — the exterior surfaces, the cladding, the windows, the paint. The skin changes on the scale of decades. A building may be re-clad, re-windowed, or re-painted every 20 to 50 years, responding to changes in weatherproofing technology, energy efficiency requirements, and aesthetic fashion.

**Services** — the HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and communication systems. Services change on the scale of 7 to 15 years. Technology evolves, regulations change, and the demands of the occupants increase. The building that was state-of-the-art in 1990 (with its CAT5 Ethernet and its R-12 refrigerant) is obsolete in 2020 (with its fiber optic and its R-410A refrigerant).

**Stuff** — the furniture, the equipment, the personal belongings. Stuff changes on the scale of months to years. People move in, rearrange the furniture, replace the equipment, and make the space their own.

The key insight of the pace layer model is that **the layers interact**. The fast layers (stuff, services) adapt to the immediate needs of the occupants. The slow layers (structure, site) provide stability and permanence. The middle layer (skin) mediates between the fast and the slow, protecting the structure from the elements while allowing the services and stuff to change.

A building that works well — that "learns" successfully, in Brand's terminology — is one where the layers can change independently. The stuff can be rearranged without modifying the services. The services can be upgraded without modifying the skin. The skin can be replaced without modifying the structure. The structure endures while everything around it changes.

A building that does not work well is one where the layers are **coupled** — where a change in one layer forces changes in other layers. The building where the furniture layout is determined by the location of the electrical outlets (stuff coupled to services). The building where the HVAC ducts are embedded in the structural concrete (services coupled to structure). The building where the exterior cladding is also the weatherproofing membrane (skin coupled to structure). These couplings prevent the building from adapting, because any change requires touching multiple layers simultaneously.

## II. Pace Layers in a Crate

What would pace layers look like in a Rust crate? Let us map Brand's layers to the structure of a software library:

**Site** — the problem domain, the fundamental abstractions, the "why" of the crate. This is the slowest-changing layer. A crate that solves serialization (`serde`) has a problem domain that changes on the scale of decades. Data formats come and go, but the fundamental act of converting between typed data and serialized bytes is as old as computing itself.

**Structure** — the core types, traits, and module organization. The structure changes on the scale of years. The `serde::Serialize` and `serde::Deserialize` traits have remained essentially unchanged since `serde` 1.0. The core abstractions — the `Serializer` and `Deserializer` traits, the data model, the derive macros — have been stable for years.

**Skin** — the public API surface, the documentation, the examples. The skin changes on the scale of months to years. New methods are added to existing types. Documentation is clarified. Examples are updated. The API evolves, but the underlying structure remains.

**Services** — the internal implementation, the performance optimizations, the platform-specific code. Services change on the scale of weeks to months. A faster serialization algorithm is implemented. A new platform is supported. A memory allocation is eliminated. The implementation changes, but the API remains.

**Stuff** — the configuration, the feature flags, the default settings. Stuff changes on the scale of days to weeks. A new feature flag is added. A default value is changed. A configuration option is exposed. The crate adapts to the immediate needs of its users without modifying its deeper layers.

The health of a crate can be assessed by how well these layers are separated. A crate with well-separated layers can evolve rapidly at the fast layers (stuff, services) while remaining stable at the slow layers (structure, site). A crate with coupled layers — where a change in the implementation (services) requires a change in the API (skin) or the core types (structure) — is brittle and resistant to change.

## III. The Low Road and the High Road

Brand distinguishes between two types of buildings: the "low road" and the "high road."

**Low-road buildings** are cheap, adaptable, and disposable. They are the warehouses, the garages, the temporary structures that are built quickly and modified freely. Brand's canonical example is Building 20 at MIT — a three-story plywood structure built in 1943 as temporary wartime laboratory space. Building 20 was so cheap and so adaptable that its occupants modified it freely: punching holes in walls for ventilation, rewiring electrical systems for new experiments, and adding partitions for new offices. Building 20 housed the Radiation Laboratory (which developed radar), the Linguistics Department (where Noam Chomsky developed his theory of generative grammar), the Tech Model Railroad Club (where the hacker culture was born), and dozens of other projects that required flexible, unconstrained space.

Building 20 was demolished in 1998, over the protests of its occupants. It had lasted 55 years — far longer than its intended lifespan — and had been one of the most creatively productive buildings in the history of MIT. Its success was not due to its architecture (which was nondescript) but to its adaptability (which was extraordinary).

**High-road buildings** are expensive, permanent, and monumental. They are the cathedrals, the palaces, the institutional buildings that are built to last centuries. Brand's canonical example is the Albert Kahn-designed buildings on the MIT campus — reinforced concrete structures with generous floor-to-floor heights, robust structural systems, and flexible interior plans. These buildings have lasted nearly a century and have been adapted to uses that Kahn could not have imagined: computer labs, clean rooms, and maker spaces.

Both the low road and the high road produce buildings that learn successfully. The difference is in the mechanism:

- The low-road building learns by being **cheap to modify**. The cost of change is so low that occupants change the building freely, adapting it to their needs without asking permission or hiring architects.
- The high-road building learns by being **robust enough to accommodate change**. The structure is so well-built that it can support many different interior configurations without structural modification.

In software, the low-road crate is the small, focused utility — the crate that does one thing, has a simple API, and can be replaced easily if it doesn't meet the user's needs. The `thiserror` crate is a low-road crate: it generates error types from derive macros, it has a minimal API, and it can be replaced by hand-written error types if necessary. Its low cost of adoption and low cost of replacement make it adaptable — users adopt it freely and replace it without regret.

The high-road crate is the large, foundational library — the crate that provides a comprehensive solution to a complex problem and is built to last. The `tokio` crate is a high-road crate: it provides a complete async runtime with task scheduling, I/O drivers, timers, and synchronization primitives. Its API is extensive, its implementation is robust, and it is designed to be the foundation of production async applications. It is not easily replaced — the cost of migration from `tokio` to another runtime is significant — but its robustness means that replacement is rarely necessary.

Both the low road and the high road are valid approaches. The danger is the **middle road** — the crate that is too large to be easily replaced but not robust enough to accommodate change. These are the crates that become maintenance burdens: they are too expensive to throw away and too fragile to modify. They are the buildings that nobody wants to occupy but nobody can afford to demolish.

## IV. Alexander's Timeless Way

Christopher Alexander, in *The Timeless Way of Building* (1979), argues that the quality that makes buildings endure is not their architectural style, their structural system, or their aesthetic appeal. It is their **aliveness** — the degree to which they support the fundamental human needs of their occupants.

Alexander defines the "quality without a name" — the property that makes a building feel alive, whole, and coherent. This quality is not aesthetic (it cannot be achieved by applying the right surface treatments), not structural (it cannot be achieved by using the right materials), and not functional (it cannot be achieved by providing the right amenities). It is **emergent** — it arises from the interaction of many small decisions, each responsive to the needs of the moment, each contributing to the wholeness of the whole.

Alexander argues that this quality is achieved through a **process** of piecemeal growth — the gradual, incremental construction and modification of a building over time, with each addition responding to the needs that have emerged since the last addition. This is the process by which medieval towns, vernacular farmhouses, and organic neighborhoods achieve their characteristic coherence — not through a master plan, but through a process of responsive, incremental growth.

In software, the equivalent process is the **iterative development** of a library or framework — the gradual, incremental addition and modification of features over time, with each addition responding to the needs of the users. This is the process by which the most successful software projects achieve their characteristic coherence — not through a grand design, but through a process of responsive, incremental growth.

The Rust standard library is a case study in this process. It was not designed as a complete, coherent whole. It started with a minimal set of types and functions (the "prelude") and has been expanded incrementally over the past decade, with each addition responding to the needs that emerged as the ecosystem grew. The `Iterator` trait was extended with adapter methods (`map`, `filter`, `collect`) as developers discovered new patterns for working with iterators. The `Future` trait was added when the async ecosystem needed a standard abstraction. The `Error` trait was evolved (and its deprecated methods were removed) as the community's understanding of error handling matured.

The standard library's coherence is not the product of a grand design. It is the product of a thousand small decisions, each responsive to the needs of the moment, each contributing to the wholeness of the whole. This is Alexander's timeless way, applied to software.

## V. Architecture as Language

Alexander's most radical claim is that architecture is a **language** — a system of patterns and relationships that can generate coherent designs at any scale. The pattern language is not a catalog of solutions but a **generative system** — a set of rules and relationships that can produce an infinite variety of designs, each adapted to its specific context, each coherent within itself.

A programming language is also a language in this sense — not just a syntax for instructing a machine, but a system of abstractions and relationships that can generate coherent programs at any scale. The Rust type system is a language: it defines a set of types, a set of relationships between types (traits, bounds, lifetimes), and a set of rules for combining types into programs. The type system generates coherent programs not by prescribing specific designs but by providing a framework within which designs can emerge.

The difference between a good programming language and a bad one — like the difference between a good pattern language and a bad one — is the degree to which the language supports the **quality without a name**: the property that makes programs feel alive, whole, and coherent. A good language produces programs that are readable, maintainable, and adaptable. A bad language produces programs that are brittle, obscure, and resistant to change.

Rust's type system, with its emphasis on ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, is a good language in this sense. It produces programs that are coherent (the ownership model ensures that data has a clear owner), maintainable (the type system catches errors at compile time), and adaptable (the trait system allows for flexible abstractions). The type system does not prescribe specific designs — it provides a framework within which designs can emerge, responsive to the needs of the moment.

This is Alexander's vision of architecture as language, applied to software: a system of abstractions and relationships that generates coherent programs, not through prescription, but through **enablement**.

## VI. The Paradox of the Mortal Architect

The paradox of architecture is that the most successful buildings are the ones that can be modified by **future** architects. A building that is so rigidly designed that it cannot be adapted — that cannot be extended, reconfigured, or repurposed — is a building that will be demolished when the needs of its occupants change. A building that is designed with adaptation in mind — with flexible floor plans, accessible services, and a robust structure — is a building that will be modified, extended, and repurposed, potentially for centuries.

The architect who designs for their own needs alone is designing a building that will outlive its usefulness as soon as the architect's needs change. The architect who designs for **unknown future needs** is designing a building that may serve purposes that the architect cannot imagine.

Software is the same. The developer who designs a module for their own use case alone is designing a module that will be discarded when the use case changes. The developer who designs a module for **unknown future use cases** is designing a module that may serve purposes that the developer cannot imagine.

This is the paradox of the mortal architect: to design something that will outlive you, you must design for people you will never meet, solving problems you cannot foresee, in a world you will never see. This requires humility — the recognition that your design is not the final word but a starting point for future designers. And it requires generosity — the willingness to leave space for others to fill.

The Rust crate that embodies this paradox most fully is `serde`. David Tolnay designed `serde` as a serialization framework, but its design is general enough to support use cases that go far beyond serialization: configuration file parsing, wire protocol implementation, data validation, schema generation, and more. `serde` has outlived the specific use cases that motivated its design and has become a general-purpose framework for converting between typed data and structured representations.

`serde` succeeds because Tolnay designed it with **unknown future use cases** in mind. He did not try to anticipate every possible use case — that would have produced a bloated, over-engineered framework. Instead, he designed a small set of powerful abstractions (the `Serializer` and `Deserializer` traits, the data model, the derive macros) that are general enough to support a wide range of use cases without being specific to any one. The result is a crate that has been adapted to uses that its author did not foresee — and that is the highest compliment that any design can receive.

## VII. Pace Layers and Crate Health

How can we assess the health of a crate using the pace layer model? Here are the questions to ask:

**Is the site well-chosen?** Does the crate solve a real, enduring problem? Or does it solve a problem that is specific to a particular technology, framework, or trend? A crate with a well-chosen site (like `serde`) has a foundation that will remain relevant for decades. A crate with a poorly chosen site (like a crate that wraps a specific cloud API) may become irrelevant within years.

**Is the structure stable?** Does the crate's core types and traits change slowly, providing a stable foundation for the faster layers? Or do the core types change frequently, requiring cascading changes throughout the crate? A crate with a stable structure can evolve its services and stuff without breaking its consumers. A crate with an unstable structure is a moving target.

**Is the skin well-defined?** Does the crate have a clear, well-documented public API that separates the skin from the services? Or are the internals exposed, coupling the skin to the services? A crate with a well-defined skin can evolve its services without changing its API. A crate with a poorly defined skin requires consumers to understand its internals.

**Are the services replaceable?** Can the internal implementation be changed without affecting the skin or the structure? Or are the implementation details baked into the public API? A crate with replaceable services can be optimized, refactored, and ported without breaking consumers. A crate with coupled services is resistant to change.

**Is the stuff configurable?** Can the crate's behavior be customized through configuration, feature flags, or extension points? Or is the behavior hardcoded? A crate with configurable stuff can be adapted to different use cases without modifying the crate itself. A crate with hardcoded stuff must be forked or rewritten to accommodate different needs.

## VIII. The Building That Teaches

The best buildings, Brand argues, are the ones that **teach** their occupants how to modify them. They are the buildings whose structure is legible — whose load-bearing walls are visible, whose service routes are accessible, whose material logic is understandable. These buildings invite modification because they make modification comprehensible. The occupant can see where to cut, where to add, where to remove, because the building's structure communicates its own logic.

The best crates are the same. They are the crates whose structure is legible — whose module organization reflects the problem domain, whose type hierarchy communicates the design intent, whose documentation explains not just *what* the code does but *why* it does it. These crates invite contribution because they make contribution comprehensible. The developer can see where to add a feature, where to fix a bug, where to optimize a hot path, because the crate's structure communicates its own logic.

The crate that outlives its author is the crate that teaches its future maintainers how to maintain it. It is the crate whose documentation explains the design decisions, whose code structure reflects the problem domain, and whose test suite captures the expected behavior. It is the building whose blueprint is legible, whose structure is accessible, and whose services are replaceable.

The building that outlived the architect is not an anomaly. It is the norm. Most buildings are maintained, modified, and repurposed by people who never met the architect. The architect's job is not to create a perfect, unchangeable artifact but to create an artifact that can be changed — an artifact that is legible, accessible, and generous enough to accommodate the needs of future occupants.

The programmer's job is the same.

---

## IX. The Architect's Farewell

There is a moment in the life of every building when the architect hands over the keys. The building is complete (or as complete as it will ever be), the occupants move in, and the architect's role shifts from creator to observer. From this point forward, the building will be shaped by forces that the architect cannot control: the needs of the occupants, the aging of the materials, the evolution of the neighborhood, and the slow, inexorable passage of time.

The best architects accept this moment with grace. They know that the building is no longer theirs — that it belongs to the people who will inhabit it, modify it, and make it their own. They know that the building will change in ways they did not anticipate, and that this is not a failure of their design but a testament to its adaptability.

The best programmers accept the same moment with the same grace. They know that the code is no longer theirs — that it belongs to the developers who will maintain it, extend it, and make it their own. They know that the code will change in ways they did not anticipate, and that this is not a failure of their design but a testament to its resilience.

Stewart Brand wrote: "A building is not something you finish. A building is something you start."

The same is true of code. A crate is not something you finish. A crate is something you start. The layers you lay down — site, structure, skin, services, stuff — are the starting point for future maintainers, future contributors, future users. The better you separate the layers, the more legible you make the structure, and the more generous you are with documentation, the more likely it is that your crate will outlive you — not as a fossil, preserved in amber, but as a living artifact, still growing, still adapting, still serving the needs of people you will never meet.

That is the architect's highest achievement: to build something that does not need you.

*The architect's epitaph: I laid the foundation. Others built the walls. Others still will fill the rooms. The building was never mine. I merely chose the site.*
