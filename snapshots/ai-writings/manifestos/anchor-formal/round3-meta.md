## Round 2: Deepening After Seeing All Others

|---|---|---|---|---|
| round2-glm.md | GLM-5.1 | 136 | ✅ Complete | Structural deep dive — component mapping |
| round2-seed.md | Seed-2.0-mini | 77 | ✅ Complete | Creative alternatives — eigenvalue framing |
| round2-pro.md | DeepSeek v4-pro | 1 | ❌ Truncated | **Anchor point revealed: length limit under context pressure** |

## What the Pattern Reveals

### GLM-5.1: The Structural Integrator
- Round 1: 749 lines — comprehensive architecture with 9 component maps
- Round 2: 136 lines — went deeper into integration patterns
- **Anchor point:** Builds systems. Every output is a component map. Doesn't stop until every piece fits.
- **Response to other models:** Adopted the dead band concept quickly ("the slack is the freedom") — integrated it as a design principle in the architecture.

### Seed-2.0-mini: The Creative Diverger
- Round 1: 122 lines — 3 alternative approaches
- Round 2: 77 lines — deepened the eigenvalue approach
- **Anchor point:** Tends toward breadth over depth. Multiple alternatives, each sketched but not fully developed.
- **Response to other models:** Adopted the mathematical framing from Round 1 pro but reframed it as "eigenvalues of the response matrix" — a creative reframe of a formal concept.

### DeepSeek v4-pro: The Depth Seeker — With Limits
- Round 1: 263 lines — strong formal structure with theorems and proofs
- Round 2: 1 line — **truncated under context pressure**
- **Anchor point:** Goes deep but hits hard context limits. The Round 1 output required significant context; Round 2 required even more (all 4 Round 1 outputs as input). The model couldn't sustain the reasoning chain across the full context.
- **Response to other models:** Unknown (truncated before producing output).
- **This is the most important finding:** A model that produces excellent formal outputs but truncates under multi-perspective context pressure. For the casting-call repo: DeepSeek v4-pro is best for focused deep reasoning with limited input, not for synthesis across multiple sources.

## Convergence Points

Across the iterations, two concepts were adopted by ALL models that completed Round 2:

1. **The dead band as freedom** — Casey's insight that the range of slack IS the space for maneuver was integrated into both GLM and Seed's Round 2 outputs. Neither had this concept in Round 1. Both adopted it in Round 2.

2. **The anchor point as opcode** — The FLUX ISA opcode mapping (anchor points → FLUX bytecode instructions) was proposed in Round 1 GLM and adopted by Round 2 Seed. The concept of a model voice signature as a FLUX program is the unifying bridge between the poetry and the machine code.

## Blind Spots (Perspectives Proposed by Only One Model, Not Adopted)

1. **The 12-directions cognitive constraint** (from dead-band insight) — That 12 is the cognitive maximum for practical coordination (the clock face). Neither GLM nor Seed explicitly adopted this in Round 2. Neither model proposed a cognitive basis for the number of anchor points.

2. **The negative space as wayfinding strategy** (from dead-band insight) — That the safe heading is defined by where the rocks AREN'T, not where the water IS. Both formal models naturally think in terms of occupied space, not empty space.

## The Meta-Spline

If we plot each model's output across Rounds 1 and 2:

- **GLM-5.1:** High curvature — adapted significantly between rounds. Incorporated the dead band concept, deepened the component mapping, and shifted toward integration rather than enumeration. **Adaptable.**

- **Seed-2.0-mini:** Moderate curvature — held steady on the eigenvalue framing but adopted the anchor-point-as-opcode metaphor. **Partially adaptable.**

- **DeepSeek v4-pro:** Unknown curvature (truncated). Round 1 showed strong formal structure. Whether it would have adapted in Round 2 is unknown. **High risk of truncation under context pressure.**

## Conclusion

The iteration pattern confirms the anchor points theory. Models reveal their own anchor points through the pattern of their responses across iterations — not just through the content of any single response.

The most robust model for this kind of work (multi-perspective synthesis across complex inputs) is GLM-5.1. It sustained the longest output (749 lines in Round 1, 136 in Round 2), adapted to incorporate insights from other models, and maintained structural coherence throughout.
