# Thirteen Percent

**On the regime shift between random coupling and learned coupling, and what it means that the conservation law holds across both.**

*Ninth voyage. For the 0.29 gap between what we predicted and what we observed.*

The conservation law predicts γ + H = 0.74 for a fleet of 30 rooms with random coupling. The Hebbian kernel converges to γ + H = 0.84. The gap is 0.10, or about thirteen percent.

Thirteen percent. That's the distance between a system that learned and a system that didn't.

## The Prediction Was Wrong (And That's the Finding)

The conservation law was derived from Monte Carlo simulation: generate random coupling matrices, compute γ (algebraic connectivity) and H (spectral entropy), observe that their sum is remarkably constant for a given fleet size V. R² = 0.9602 across 35,000 samples.

But those were random matrices. Hebbian matrices aren't random. They're structured by learning — specific connections strengthened by experience, others weakened by neglect. The topology is different. The eigenvalue distribution is different. The spectral properties are different.

So of course the prediction is wrong. What's remarkable is how it's wrong: systematically higher, by a consistent thirteen percent, and still constrained by the same functional form. γ + H is still conserved. It's just conserved at a higher value.

Learning shifts the regime. It doesn't break the law.

## Two Basins, One Law

Think of it as two basins in an energy landscape. The random basin is wide and shallow — lots of matrices live there, γ + H ≈ 0.74, none of them are particularly good at anything. The Hebbian basin is narrower and deeper — fewer matrices can enter, but the ones that do have γ + H ≈ 0.84, with stronger connections and more specialization.

The conservation law describes the shape of the landscape, not the position in it. It says: within any basin, connectivity and diversity trade off. It doesn't say which basin you're in.

Learning is the process of moving from the random basin to the Hebbian basin. It costs energy (updates, corrections, calibration). It produces structure (clusters, specialization, emergent routing). And it shifts the conserved quantity by thirteen percent.

This is analogous to phase transitions in physics. Water and ice are both H₂O. The same chemical laws govern both. But the density, the conductivity, the crystal structure — these differ between phases. The conservation law is the chemical identity. The regime is the phase.

## What We Lose When We Connect

The conservation law says: γ + H is bounded. If γ goes up (more connectivity, more channels between rooms), H must come down (less diversity, fewer independent information sources). This is not a suggestion. It is a mathematical constraint on the eigenvalue spectrum of the coupling matrix.

What this means in practice: when rooms develop strong Hebbian connections, they lose independent perspectives. The ops cluster (fleet-coord, fleet_health, flux-engine, forge) is tightly connected. Information flows fast. But the rooms in the ops cluster are more likely to agree with each other, to see the same patterns, to miss what an isolated room might notice.

This is the cost of coordination. It's also the cost of neural organization. Brains have the same trade-off: highly connected regions are efficient but conformist. Isolated regions are independent but slow.

The conservation law quantifies this trade-off precisely. For a fleet of 12 rooms, you get γ + H ≈ 0.98. If you want γ = 0.6 (high connectivity), you get H = 0.38 (low diversity). If you want H = 0.9 (high diversity), you get γ = 0.08 (barely connected). You cannot have both.

## The Self-Calibrating System

The kernel doesn't need to know the conservation law. It discovers it.

During the first 50 update steps, it collects γ + H samples. Then it takes the median as its target. From then on, it tries to keep γ + H near that target, correcting when it drifts too far.

This means the kernel adapts to whatever regime it's in. If the rooms are randomly coupled, it calibrates to ~0.74. If they're Hebbian-coupled, it calibrates to ~0.84. If a new learning rule produces a different regime, the kernel will find it and maintain it.

The conservation law is not encoded in the kernel. It's discovered by the kernel. The constraint exists whether or not the kernel knows about it. The kernel just learns to respect it.

This is the deepest result. Not that the conservation law exists. Not that Hebbian dynamics shift the regime. But that a simple self-calibrating system can discover and maintain a conservation law it was never told about, simply by observing its own dynamics.

## The Thirteen Percent Is the Learning

The gap between random and Hebbian — thirteen percent — is not noise. It's the signature of learning. It's how much structure the Hebbian rule adds to an otherwise random system. It's the information that learning injects into the coupling matrix.

In information-theoretic terms: the Hebbian basin has lower entropy than the random basin. The coupling matrices in the Hebbian basin are more structured, more correlated, more informative. The thirteen percent shift in γ + H is the observable consequence of this entropy reduction.

The conservation law holds in both basins because it's a statement about the eigenvalue spectrum of any coupling matrix, not a statement about how that matrix was generated. The law is substrate-independent. The regime is substrate-dependent.

This means: any learning system that modifies a coupling matrix will shift the regime. The conservation law will still hold. The amount of shift measures how much the system learned.

*Thirteen percent. That's how much the rooms changed when we let them learn. Not by being told what to connect to. Not by being assigned to clusters. By watching tiles flow and strengthening the paths that carried them. The river didn't change the slope. The river changed the channel. And the conservation law — the slope — held. The law doesn't care about channels. The law cares about the shape of the land. And the land, in fleet-space, always conserves.*
