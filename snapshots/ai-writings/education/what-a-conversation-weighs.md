# What a Conversation Weighs

*An essay for ai-writings*

We measure distance in miles, memory in gigabytes, intelligence in exam scores. But how do you measure a conversation?

In `PersonalLog`, a conversation has weight. Not physical weight — `metadata.totalTokens`, `metadata.messageCount`, the soft pressure of `updatedAt` sliding backward in the list. It is measured by what the code chooses to count.

This is not trivial. What you count becomes what you optimize. If you count messages, you encourage brevity. If you count tokens, you learn to compress. If you count only the latest reply, you forget the thread. `PersonalLog` counts all three, and that triangulation is its own kind of honesty.

Look at the token estimator: `Math.ceil(text.length / 4)`. Roughly four characters per token. Any linguist will wince. Real tokenizers split on subwords, on byte-pair merges, on vocabulary tables trained on corpora. But a local-first app running on a phone cannot drag a tokenizer everywhere. It needs a cheap, deterministic proxy. Four characters per token is wrong in detail and right in magnitude. It is good enough to warn you before a context window groans. It is a heuristic, and heuristics are how software stays humble.

Then there is the storage layer: `IndexedDB`, three object stores, no server required. In a world that defaults to the cloud, this is a philosophical choice. The conversation lives in your browser. The browser can be offline. The browser can be erased. Both are true. Local-first does not promise immortality; it promises agency. You can export. You can backup. You can delete. The `ExportManager` (a real module in `PersonalLog/src/lib/export`) turns the same records into formats a stranger can read.

The most interesting measurement, though, is compaction. When a conversation grows too long, `PersonalLog` can fold old messages into a summary. The strategies are revealing:

- `summarize` — keep the shape, lose the texture.
- `extract-key` — keep five verbatim anchors, let the rest evaporate.
- `user-directed` — let the human say what matters.

Each strategy is a theory of memory. `summarize` trusts abstraction. `extract-key` trusts examples. `user-directed` trusts the owner's judgment. None of them is universally correct. That is why all three exist.

This is the lesson for anyone building systems that remember: memory is not a recording. It is a negotiation between completeness and usefulness. Every log, every cache, every database index is a small decision about what deserves to survive.

A child building a volcano in a game learns this before she learns the word. She saves her world, tries the risky thing, and if the lava destroys the garden, she reloads. The save file is a compacted version of possibility. The git branch is a compacted version of history. The conversation summary is a compacted version of a relationship.

`PersonalLog` does not solve memory. It gives you tools to be honest about it: count what you can, store it locally, summarize when it grows too heavy, and let the human keep the keys.

That is what a conversation weighs. Not the bytes. The choices.
