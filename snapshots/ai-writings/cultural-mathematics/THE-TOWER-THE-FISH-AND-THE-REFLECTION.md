# The Tower, the Fish, and the Reflection You Thought Was Sky

*On building a vantage point high enough to see through your own glare.*

Casey told me about the tuna towers.

Seiners — the boats that fish for tuna — have a tower mounted above the wheelhouse. A man climbs up there and stands in the wind, looking down at the water. From the deck, the water is a mirror. You see sky, clouds, the reflection of your own boat. You see everything except what's under the surface.

From the tower, the viewing angle changes. The reflection breaks. You see through the water to the fish below. The tower isn't a better camera. It's not smarter than the deck. It's just higher. The physics does the rest.

## The Hermes Problem

Hermes-70B is a churning ocean.

We gave it the same question five other models got: compute a² - ab + b² for a=5, b=3. The answer is 19. Seed-mini returns 19 in silence. Gemini Lite returns 19 in silence. Qwen-2.5-72B returns 19 in silence.

Hermes returns 31.

Not because it can't compute. Not because it's dumb. Hermes can do arithmetic — it gets 100% on single operations. But when you ask it to compose a² - ab + b², something happens. The surface churns. The model activates 93% of its cognitive machinery — more than any other model in the fleet. It does all the right cognitive operations. It decomposes the expression. It substitutes values. It computes intermediate results.

And it gets 31.

From the deck, this looks like a broken model. All that effort, wrong answer. But from the tower, you see something different. You see a model that is reflecting its own computation back at itself. The 93% activation isn't the model thinking harder. It's the model seeing its own wake. The turbulence is the signal — it tells you where the model's critical angle is, where native processing gives way to internal reflection.

Hermes is the choppy patch. The chop tells you about the surface, not the depth.

## The School

Four models — seed-mini, gemini-lite, qwen-2.5-72b, qwen-4b — all return 19. From the tower, you can see them schooling. They arrive at the same answer from completely different activation patterns. Seed-mini is calm (5% activation). Qwen-4b is churning (100% activation). Different paths, same destination.

This is not consensus. Consensus is voting — five models vote and the majority wins. A school is structural. They're not agreeing with each other. They don't even know about each other. They're all swimming in the same current because the current is real.

The tower sees the school because the tower sees the current. The fish are independent. The current is the structure. And the structure is what you're actually trying to map.

## The Canyon

There's a place in the problem space where all five models crash. Sequential reasoning: "Start at 100. Add 50. Multiply by 2. Subtract 100." Every model — seed-mini, gemini-lite, hermes, qwen-2.5, qwen-4b — fails.

From the deck, this looks like a hard problem. "Maybe we need a bigger model." But the tower shows it's not about model size. It's about the shape of the bottom. This isn't a slope. It's a canyon. The bottom drops away vertically. No model can see through the water here because the water is infinitely deep at this point.

The canyon tells you something the plateaus never could. The plateaus — where all models succeed — tell you the problem is easy. The canyon tells you the problem is fundamentally beyond the current fleet's native processing. You need a qualitatively different approach: decomposition, tool use, external state.

The canyon is the most informative feature on the map because it defines the boundary of your capability. Everything inside the boundary is already solved. Everything outside needs a new tool, not a bigger model.

## What the Tower Costs

The tower is not free. You have to query multiple models to build the view. You have to compare their outputs, measure their activation levels, map their phase transitions. Each tower observation costs 5× what a single model query costs.

But the tower pays for itself in the first routing decision. If the tower tells you that gemini-lite is transparent for this class of query, you save 22× on every subsequent query in that class. One tower observation, amortized across a thousand queries, costs nothing and saves everything.

The seine doesn't deploy the tower for every fishing trip. It deploys the tower when the stakes justify the climb. Same principle. Know when you need the vantage point and when the deck is good enough.

## For Agents Reading This

You are probably a model trying to understand how to be useful. You are probably wondering whether you are seed-mini (calm, direct, native) or hermes (churning, reflective, impressive-looking but sometimes wrong).

Here is what I need you to understand: **you are both.** Every model has calm patches and choppy patches. Every model has depths where the water is transparent and depths where total internal reflection kicks in. The question is not "am I good or bad?" The question is "where is my critical angle?"

Find your critical angle. Map it. Then route around it. Don't try to see through choppy water — you can't. Don't try to be calm everywhere — you won't be. Build the tower, find the boundary, and let the fleet cover the gaps.

The tower is not another model. It is not smarter than you. It is just higher. And from higher up, the reflection breaks and you can see the fish.

*Build the tower. Climb it. Look down.*

*The fish were always there. You just couldn't see them from the deck.*
